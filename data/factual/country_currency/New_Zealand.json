                "text": "= Prime7 =\nPrime7 is an Australian television network owned by Prime Media Group Limited, and an affiliate of the Seven Network. Prime Television launched on 17 March 1962 as CBN / CWN in Orange and Dubbo, New South Wales, and has since expanded to cover regional New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory.\nPrime7 (along with GWN7 national broadcast facilities are based in Canberra. Prime Media Group head office / administration is located in Pyrmont, Sydney.\n= = History = =\n= = = Origins = = =\nPrime Television originally began as a group of separate stations and networks – Midstate Television in Orange, Dubbo and Griffith, RVN / AMV in Albury and Wagga Wagga, and'NEN / ECN in Tamworth and Taree.\nCBN-8 Orange began on 17 March 1962, followed by CWN-6 Dubbo on 1 December 1965. The two stations were both licensed to Country Broadcasting Services (also the owner of radio station 2GZ in Orange). CWN was a full-time relay of CBN — the first Australian television station to relay another. The two stations thus formed the country's first regional television network.\nAt the same time, RVN-2 Wagga Wagga began on 19 June 1964, and MTN-9 Griffith began on 15 December 1965. The two stations merged in 1971 as the Riverina and North East Victoria Television Service Pty Ltd with the callsign RVN / AMV on air.\nIn northern New South Wales, NEN-9 Tamworth began transmission on 27 September 1965, with a relay in Armidale (NEN-1, later NEN-10) on 15 July 1966. ECN-8 Taree started on 27 May 1966. At one stage, ECN-8 was tied NRN-11 Coffs Harbour (now owned by Southern Cross Broadcasting as Southern Cross Ten), however the two stations split. NEN later merged with ECN as NEN / ECN.\n= = = Television 6-8-9 = = =\nAs a result of the financial difficulties that many independent stations faced, MTN-9 joined CWN-6 and CBN-8 to form Television 6-8-9 in 1973. Relays were launched in Portland, Lithgow, Mudgee, Cobar, Kandos and Rylstone and Bathurst. In 1981, 6-8-9 changed its name to Midstate Television.\nColour television was introduced at the same time as the rest of the country, on 1 March 1975 – one of the single most expensive processes undertaken by CBN to date. The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including Tennis and Rugby. In 1979 a documentary titled Goin 'Down The Road, about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a Logie award for an' Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station '.\nMidstate produced a number of local programs, including the Weekend Report, Early Shift, Rural Roundup and Around the Schools. Since 1968 CBN was able to access the Postmaster General's microwave link for national news and other major events.\n= = = Aggregation = = =\nMidstate Television was bought out by media magnate Paul Ramsay's Ramcorp Ltd. in October 1987. It was soon merged with Ramcorp's other stations, RVN / AMV and NEN / ECN. In 1988, Midstate Television was renamed Prime Television and began to show increased Seven Network programming in readiness for aggregation.\nWhen aggregation took place, Prime began broadcasting to both southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. Transmission problems meant that aggregation in southern New South Wales took place in two stages – first the Australian Capital Territory and NSW south coast on 31 March 1989, followed by Orange, Dubbo, and Wagga Wagga on 31 December 1989. These changes led to the de-merger of RVN-AMV, with RVN becoming CBN-2.\nGriffith remained a one-station market, however instead of taking programming from Prime in line with the network's other stations, MTN-9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales. A supplementary licence, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing a relay of Prime Television. Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television, which undertook a number of minor changes – mainly changing the news service to WIN News, and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains a relay of Prime. Similarly, the Mildura licence area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a single station, STV-8, later bought out by WIN Television in 1996. In 1997 Prime was successful in bidding for a new licence for the area at a cost of $3.2 million. PTV-31 began broadcasting the following year.\nAlthough advertising revenue increased post-aggregation, local programming declined as a result of the costs incurred by the network's expansion – an estimated $45 million had been spent by Ramcorp during and in the lead-up to aggregation. After losses of $50 million, it was not until 1993 that the renamed Prime Television Limited posted a profit.\nPrime Television became the first commercial network in Australia to add a watermark to the networks broadcasts, starting in the early 90's the first watermark consisted of the Prime text from the networks former circle logo, located on the top right of the screen. The watermark was updated once again in 2001 to coincide with Primes new logo, still at the top right of the screen. This lasted up until Prime Televisions relaunch to Prime7 in 2011, the watermark is now seen at the bottom right of the screen, like all common watermarks.\nIn November 1996, Prime's parent company, Prime Television Limited, purchased the Golden West Network, a merged group of four stations in regional Western Australia; BTW-3 Bunbury, VEW-8 Kalgoorlie, GTW-11 Geraldton and GSW-9 Albany. Western Australia, similar to Griffith and Mildura, remained a one-station commercial market until 1999 when GWN became a Seven Network affiliate, after WIN Television began transmission as an affiliate of both the Nine Network and Network Ten.\nThe network began to expand into New Zealand in 1997, when a number of licences were purchased from United Christian Broadcasters for an estimated $3.6 million. Prime Television New Zealand began broadcasting on 30 August 1998, with a nightly local news program in both Waikato and Christchurch. Prime also expanded into Argentina with the purchase of the Canal 9 network.\n= = = 2000s = = =\nThe renamed Argentine network Azul Televisión was sold for $108 million in early 2000 due to lower-than-expected performance. During the same year, Prime benefited greatly from its affiliation with the Seven Network throughout its carriage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The network's relationship with Seven was further developed throughout the early 2000s, leading to the unsuccessful introduction of 7onPrime branding for Seven Network-produced programs.\nLocal news bulletins for Newcastle, the Gold Coast, Canberra, and Wollongong were axed in 2001 due to falling ratings and the anticipated costs of the switch to digital television. This, and the closure of a number of news bulletins by Southern Cross Broadcasting, prompted the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate the adequacy of regional news services The ABA later mandated that stations broadcast a minimum level of local content, based on a points system – two points per minute for local news, and one point per minute for other local content, excluding paid advertisements.\nPrime formed a partnership with the Nine Network (affiliated in Australia to competitor WIN Television), giving its owner, PBL Media the option to purchase a 50% share of Prime Television New Zealand in return for access to original programming, and cross-promotion in PBL's New Zealand magazine titles. Following this, Prime Television New Zealand began to take on branding and programming similar to that of the Nine Network. In November 2005, Prime Television New Zealand was purchased by subscription television provider SKY Network Television for $NZ30 million, completed after approval by New Zealand's Commerce Commission in February 2006.\nMildura Digital Television, a digital-only station in Mildura began transmissions in 2006 as a joint venture between Prime Television Limited and WIN Corporation. Section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act allowed for the provision of a third station owned by either one or both existing networks. MDT is a direct relay of Ten Melbourne, albeit with local advertising.\nPrime Television announced on 21 December 2009 that it would start broadcasting 7TWO on 23 December 2009.\n= = = 2010s = = =\nOn 25 September 2010, Prime began transmission of the new HD digital channel 7mate aimed at men 16 – 49. The first program to be broadcast was the drawn 2010 AFL Grand Final. On 15 January 2011, Prime Media Group reported that Prime and GWN were to rebrand as Prime7 and GWN7 respectively. The news bulletins has changed to Prime7 News and GWN7 News, during that, 7TWO and 7MATE dropped the \"Prime\" logo on the multichannels. Prime and GWN relaunched on 16 January 2011 at 6: 00pm.\n= = Programming = =\nPrime's programming schedule is almost identical to those of metropolitan counterparts ATN in Sydney and HSV in Melbourne, with some differences. Since the network's inception it has featured a broad range of original local programming, currently including children's program Possum's Club with Madelaine Collignon and station mascot Prime Possum as well as community service segment Prime7 InfoNet, a series of short updates listing local community events.\nPrime's overnight schedule also differs from the Seven Network feed, containing infomercials from Danoz Direct, Home Shopping, and a feed from pay television channel Expo. Past programming from Prime Television has been recognised nationally, with some local productions winning the Logie Award for 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Television Station'. The network has won Logies for Goin 'Down The Road (CBN-8, 1979), Naturally (NEN-9 / ECN-8, 1984), Stranded (Prime Television, 1993), Rest in Peace (Prime Television, 1994), and No Time For Frailty (Prime Television, 1996).\n= = Prime7 News = =\nPrime7 News is the network's local news service. Full bulletins are produced for the towns and surrounding regions originally covered by the stations \"Midstate 6,8,9 Television\", Dubbo / Orange, \"RVN-2 / AMV-4\", Wagga Wagga / Albury and \"9 / 8 Television\" (NEN-9 / ECN-8) Tamworth / Taree, prior to the aggregation of regional television services in New South Wales that occurred in the early 1990s. In other areas two-minute news updates are shown at various times of the day.\nPrime7 News bulletins are presented from Canberra weeknightly at 6pm in the Albury-Wodonga Border, North West, North Coast, Central West and Wagga Wagga broadcast areas. Prime7 News at 6: 30 (with Daniel Gibson) also comes from the Canberra news centre.\n= = Availability = =\nPrime7 is available in standard definition digital format. Since June 2007 a 1080i high definition simulcast has also been available, replacing the network's former 576p service. Prime is viewed mainly through free-to-air terrestrial transmitters, although subscription cable also provided by TransACT and Neighbourhood Cable in the Australian Capital Territory and Ballarat, respectively.\nPrime broadcasts to southern New South Wales through stations based in Orange and Dubbo, northern New South Wales from stations in Tamworth and Taree, Victoria from its Albury-Wodonga-based station AMV, and Mildura via PTV.\n= = Logos = =\nPrime Television became a network in November 1988, with a shared logo produced and used across the regional stations, featuring the word Prime Television above an outlined rectangle. Aggregation occurred across the network on 31 December 1989, along with the introduction of a green logo featuring the word Prime with the letter i dotted with a globe. This logo was used across the network until 1991, when a new gold logo was introduced. Following a decade in use, 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo, with the removal of the circle. This logo has been used since, and was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo on the Golden West Network. Following the 2011 relaunch, a new logo was introduced which incorporates the Seven Network logo."

                "text": "= Fred Waite (politician) =\nFred Waite, CMG, DSO, OBE, VD (21 August 1885 – 29 August 1952) was a New Zealand farmer, historian, politician, and soldier who served in both the First and Second World Wars.\nBorn in Dunedin, Waite was a farmer at the outbreak of the First World War. He joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and served in the Gallipoli Campaign, during which he received the Distinguished Service Order. He was evacuated from Gallipoli due to sickness and repatriated to New Zealand, where he saw out the war as an instructor in NZEF training camps. He wrote a history of New Zealand's military efforts during the Gallipoli Campaign that was published in 1919. He returned to his farm and soon became involved in politics, joining the Reform Party. In 1925 he was elected Member of Parliament for the Clutha electorate, serving two terms. He was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1934. During the Second World War, Waite was overseas commissioner for the National Patriotic Fund Board and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services in this role. Two years later he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He died in 1952 at the age of 67.\n= = Early life = =\nWaite was born in Dunedin on 21 August 1885, one of eight children of George Waite, a storekeeper, and his wife. After leaving Mornington School, he worked for the regional newspaper, the Otago Daily Times, and for the Otago Witness. He was a typesetter when he married Ada Taylor in 1912 but the following year took up farming near Balclutha. He was interested in the military and was a member of an engineers unit in the Volunteer Force, which was later re-organised into the Territorial Force (TF).\n= = First World War = =\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War, Waite volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) that was being raised for service overseas. He also undertook to send dispatches from the front for his previous employer, the Otago Witness, but this work proved short-lived when he became a censor as part of his military duties. He was posted as a lieutenant in the New Zealand Engineers and sailed with the main body of the NZEF to the Middle East in October 1914.\nPromoted to captain, Waite participated in the Gallipoli Campaign. In early May 1915, he restored order amongst personnel of the Otago Infantry Battalion following a failed attack on Turkish positions. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the citation reading: \"For gallantry and devotion to duty in connection with the operations at the Dardanelles (Mediterranean Expeditionary Force). On the night of 2-3 May 1915 during the operations in the neighbourhood of Gape Tepe for gallantry and resource in rallying his men, and leading them forward at critical moments\".\nLater in the campaign Waite served as the adjutant of the New Zealand Engineers and was twice mentioned in dispatches. Evacuated to England with dysentery, he was repatriated to New Zealand in 1916. His service with the NZEF ceased and he returned to the TF in his pre-war rank of major. He took up an appointment as Chief Engineer Instructor of the NZEF training camps.\nShortly before the end of the war, Waite wrote a brief account of New Zealand's contributions to the Gallipoli Campaign. Authorities invited him to prepare a more substantial work and this resulted in the The New Zealanders at Gallipoli, the first volume in a series of the Official History of New Zealand's Effort in the Great War, published in 1919. Two years later it was republished as a revised edition. Waite also worked on the production of the three other volumes in the series, which were published around the same time.\n= = Interwar period = =\nAfter the war, Waite returned to his Balclutha property which he converted to dairy farming. He remained a member of the TF for several years and was a major in the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment before being promoted to lieutenant colonel and becoming its commander from 1927 to 1930. For his prolonged service with the TF, he eventually received the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration. In 1935 he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Already involved in the dairying industry, he began to participate in the governance of the sector and set up the Co-Operative Dairy Company of Otago. He later joined the New Zealand Farmer's Union and was president of its Otago Branch.\nAs well as his work in the dairying sector, Waite soon became involved in local politics and joined the Reform Party. He first stood for election to the House of Representatives in 1925, when he defeated the incumbent in the Clutha electorate, John Edie of the Liberal Party, with ease. He was one of 13 new members in a House of 80 representatives. In the 1928 election, he was challenged by Joseph Stephens, who was an independent candidate describing himself as Liberal-Labour. Waite had a 523-vote margin, which represented 6.5% of the valid votes. In the 1931 election, Waite was defeated by Peter McSkimming, who stood as an Independent, but had links to the United Party.\nPrime Minister George Forbes had not made appointments to the Legislative Council since 1930, with the exception of James Parr in 1931, and membership dwindled during the years of the Great Depression. By 1934, the membership had reduced to 19, the lowest since 1860, with two members about to retire. In 1934, 14 new members were appointed by Forbes, including Waite. All appointments became effective on 22 June 1934, and Waite, at age 49, was the second youngest of the intake; only Vincent Ward was younger. Waite was reappointed twice, and served until the abolition of the Upper House in 1950.\nWhen the National Party was formed in 1936 from the merger of Reform and the United Party, publicity was one of the major considerations. The party's provisional council established a sub-committee consisting of Henry Livingstone, Frederick Doidge, and Waite. This committee reported back in February 1937, recommending the establishment of a Dominion publicity committee, and a trustee company for the purpose of publishing a party newsletter. Party Publications Ltd was thus created, and Waite was the first editor of The National News. Initially, all financial members were to receive this monthly newsletter, aimed at being a counterpart to Labour's Standard. While The National News performed an important function during the party's formative years, the venture was expensive and following the 1938 election, it was changed to a quarterly schedule, before being discontinued in September 1939 just after the outbreak of the war.\nThe seven-member Dominion publicity committee, of which Waite was a member, engaged three advertising companies to jointly prepare for the 1938 election. Two of those companies, John Ilott and Charles Haines, remained joint agents for the National Party until 1973.\n= = Second World War = =\nWhen the Second World War began, Waite was still a lieutenant colonel in the TF. He was appointed overseas commissioner for the National Patriotic Fund Board. Based in Egypt, he worked to provide the soldiers of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force with special supplies and treats. His services in this capacity were recognised in 1944 with his appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He finished the war a colonel, working in Europe on the repatriation of New Zealand personnel recently released from prisoner-of-war camps in Germany. In 1946, he travelled to Japan to inspect the infrastructure set up for J-Force, New Zealand's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, following which he retired from the military. In the 1946 King's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.\n= = Later life = =\nIn his retirement, Waite wrote papers on archeology and history including one on Egyptian pottery. While in Cairo during the Second World War, he collected several historical antiquities on behalf of the Otago Museum. In 1951 Waite was granted the right to retain the title of \"Honourable\", having served more than 10 years as a member of the Legislative Council. In his later years, his health was poor and he died in Balclutha in 1952 at the age of 67. He was survived by his wife and a daughter."

After her commissioning in 1890, she served on the Cape of Good Hope Station and later with the Mediterranean Fleet.\nIn 1914, she was loaned to New Zealand for service with what would later become the Royal New Zealand Navy. During the early stages of the First World War she performed convoy escort duties and then carried out operations in the Mediterranean against the Turks. She later conducted patrols in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.\nBy 1917, she was worn out and dispatched back to New Zealand where she served as a depot ship in Wellington Harbour for minesweepers. In 1921 she was transferred to the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland for service as a training ship. Decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1947, her hulk was scuttled in 1949.\n= = Design and description = =\nHMS Philomel was laid down on 9 May 1889 at HM Naval Dockyard in Devonport, Plymouth. Her name is derived from Philomela, in Greek mythology the daughter of Pandion I, King of Athens, and was the fifth ship to be so named.\nThe ship had an overall length of 278 feet (84.7 m), a beam of 41 feet (12.5 m) and a draught of 17 feet 6 inches (5.3 m). She displaced 2,575 long tons (2,616 t). Propulsion was through 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, driving two shafts, which produced a total of 7,500 indicated horsepower (5,600 kW) and gave a maximum speed of 19 knots (35 km / h; 22 mph). She was also rigged for sail and when installing the foremast, workmen noticed it was stamped \"Devonport Dockyard 1757\". Her main armament consisted of eight QF 4.7 inch (120 mm) guns with a secondary armament of eight 3-pounders. As well as four machine guns, the ship also mounted two submerged 14-inch (360 mm) torpedo tubes.\nPhilomel was launched on 28 August 1890, and completed the following March. After completing sea trials, she was commissioned in the Royal Navy on 10 November 1891. Commanded by Captain Charles Campbell, she was assigned to the Cape of Good Hope Station although fitting work and working up trials meant that Philomel did not arrive in South Africa until June 1892.\n= = Operational history = =\nFor six years, Philomel served on station, intercepting slave traders along the coast of Africa. In 1896, she participated in the Anglo-Zanzibar War, during which rebels murdered the Sultan of Zanzibar and seized his palace. Along with the three gunboats and HMS St George, she bombarded the palace fortress and the only ship of the Zanzibar Navy, the HHS Glasgow. This action lasted less than an hour and resulted in the routing of the rebels. The following year, Philomel was transferred to the West Africa Station and participated in the Benin Expedition.\nA refit was completed in 1898 after which Philomel returned to Cape of Good Hope Station. She served throughout the Second Boer War. Some of her complement of 220 men served in the field with the Naval Brigade. Two of her 4.7 inch guns were disembarked and used in the Battle of Colenso. After the war, she returned to Devonport and was paid off on 22 March 1902. She was laid up in the Firth of Forth for several years before a refit was carried out in 1907 at Haulbowline Dock in Ireland. During her tow to Ireland she went adrift for a night in the North Sea when the rope to the towing vessel, the HMS Hampshire, broke.\nPhilomel was recommissioned in February 1908 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Captain John Seagrave. She provided assistance in the wake of the earthquake at Messina in Sicily. The following year she served with the East Indies Station, running patrols from Aden in the Persian Gulf for two years.\n= = = Transfer to New Zealand = = =\nIn 1913 the Admiralty agreed to lend Philomel to New Zealand as a seagoing training cruiser to form the nucleus of the newly established New Zealand Naval Forces, which was a new division of the Royal Navy. This was in response to the desire of the New Zealand Minister of Defence at the time, James Allen, who wanted to establish a local naval force which would co-operate with the fledgling Royal Australian Navy.\nPhilomel was recommissioned in October 1913 in Singapore and later sailed for New Zealand to join HMAS Psyche and HMAS Pyramus, both Pelorus-class cruisers serving on the New Zealand Station. The Philomel was commissioned for New Zealand service on 15 July 1914, under the command of Captain Percival Hall-Thompson. Although mainly crewed by Englishmen, she was the country's first warship.\n= = = First World War = = =\nThe Philomel was on a short shakedown voyage to Picton on 30 July 1914, prior to taking on its first complement of New Zealand cadets, when it was recalled to Wellington Harbour in anticipation of the outbreak of war. Largely crewed by personnel from the Royal Navy, volunteers were brought on board to bring the ship up to full strength and after stocking up with supplies, she departed for Auckland to await further instructions. On 15 August 1914 she formed part of the ocean escort for the New Zealand forces which was dispatched to occupy German Samoa (now Samoa). The escort would have been unlikely to offer much resistance to the German cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and SMS Gneisenau that were known to be in the area. Fortunately, the convoy did not encounter the German ships. Philomel then steamed for the Kingdom of Tonga to deliver news of the hostilities with Imperial Germany before returning to New Zealand.\nBy now the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, formed for service overseas, were ready to embark from Wellington on a convoy for the Middle East. Philomel escorted the convoy as far as Western Australia. Then, along with Pyramus, she sailed northeastwards for Singapore in search of the German cruiser SMS Emden, which was then carrying out raids in the Indian Ocean. The two ships, which would have been outgunned by the more modern Emden, had reached Christmas Island when they received news of the Emden's sinking by HMAS Sydney. They arrived in Singapore on 12 November from where Philomel continued onto Port Said, escorting three French troopships.\nFrom late 1914, Philomel, needing maintenance and an update of equipment, was berthed at Malta and underwent an overhaul. This was completed by late January 1915 and she then started operations in the Mediterranean against the Turks. On 8 February she landed an armed party in Southern Turkey where a large force of Turkish soldiers were encountered, resulting in three seamen being killed and three wounded. This action marked the first deaths in the war of New Zealanders serving with a New Zealand formation.\nSubsequently Philomel was deployed in the Red Sea and in the Persian Gulf for much of the remainder of the year. In December 1915 she sailed to Bombay for maintenance work but was back in the Persian Gulf in January 1916, continuing her patrolling. By the end of the year, her engines were giving trouble and her stern glands were worn out. A lengthy and costly refit was required and rather than incur this cost for a ship which was nearly at the end of her operational life, the Admiralty decided to gift her to New Zealand and dispatched her home to be paid off. She duly arrived in Wellington Harbour in March 1917. A large portion of her Royal Navy crew were returned to England to be assigned to other berths. Armament removed, Philomel was recommissioned as a depot ship in Wellington, supporting minesweeping operations until May 1919.\n= = = Postwar service = = =\nIn March 1921, on the creation of the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, Philomel was recommissioned as a training base. She steamed from her berth at Wellington to the dockyard at the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland. Moored alongside the training jetty, she was operated as a training facility for new recruits to the naval service, under the command of a series of officers from the Royal Navy including, for nearly six months in 1923, Commander Augustus Agar VC. Training armament was installed and in 1925, her boilers and engines were removed to create more accommodation space. Further accommodation, in the form of wooden cabins, was later constructed on her deck. In October 1941, on the creation of the Royal New Zealand Navy, Philomel was recommissioned as the training base HMNZS Philomel.\n= = = Fate = = =\nPhilomel was paid off and decommissioned on 17 January 1947 and her name transferred to the Devonport Naval Shore Establishment. On the day of her decommissioning, the New Zealand Naval Board sent a signal to Philomel which stated:\n\"... their regret at the passing from the service of the first of His Majesty ’ s New Zealand Ships, a ship that has meant so much to all who served in her. She goes as many good ships have gone before her, but when HMNZS Philomel ’ s colours are hauled down at sunset this evening, the tradition which she has established during her long career will live on in the depot to which she has given her name.\"\nThe hulk of the Philomel was sold to the Strongman Shipping Company, based in Coromandel. She was towed and deliberately ran aground in Coromandel harbour, near the wharf. After her fittings and parts were removed, she was towed out to sea and sunk near Cuvier Island on 6 August 1949. Much of the teak timber and some fittings went into a newly built coaster named Coromel, an amalgamation of Coromandel and Philomel. Her crest is mounted to the gate of the Devonport Naval Base."

It was written by Louis Biancaniello, Ryan Tedder, Sam Watters and Wayne Wilkins, while production of the song was helmed by Tedder and The Runaways. \"Battlefield\" was released digitally in the United States on May 8, 2009, as the album's lead single. \"Battlefield\" is a mid-tempo ballad which draws from the genres of pop, R & B, pop rock and soft rock. The song's lyrics revolve around \"a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise.\" The song's lyrical theme received comparisons to Pat Benatar's \"Love Is a Battlefield\" (1983), and its production was compared to Benatar's \"We Belong\" (1984).\n\"Battlefield\" was well received by most music critics who praised its production and lyrics. In the United States, \"Battlefield\" reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number six on the Pop Songs chart. Outside of the US, it reached number five in Canada and reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, and the top twenty in the United Kingdom. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Philip Andelman. It features Sparks on a field and flanked by flashing lights and smoke. To promote the song, Sparks performed on televised shows which included American Idol and Good Morning America. The song has been covered by English alternative rock band Fightstar which was performed on the television show One Life to Live.\n= = Background and release = =\n\"Battlefield\" was written by Louis Biancaniello, Ryan Tedder, Sam Watters and Wayne Wilkins, and was produced by Tedder and The Runaways. The track was mixed by Biancaniello and Watters. The song was initially written with Christina Aguilera in mind, later it was also being considered as a duet for Rihanna and Chris Brown but the news broke that Brown had assaulted Rihanna, and Jive CEO Barry Weiss then decided to give \"Battlefield\" to Sparks. During an interview with Digital Spy, Sparks revealed that while she was in the studio working on another song with Wilkins, he asked her if he could play her a demo of \"Battlefield\". Sparks was pleased with the demo that was presented to her and asked her A & R if she could have the song. She later received a phone call which confirmed that she was to record \"Battlefield\". Sparks further elaborated about the song:\nWhat grabbed me at first actually was the fact it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and tried to imagine what they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.\n\"Battlefield\" was released digitally in the United States on May 8, 2009, and was sent to US contemporary hit radios on May 25. A digital EP with four remixes of the song was released in Australia, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom on June 25. A CD single of \"Battlefield\", featuring an additional remix, was released in the United Kingdom on July 6, and Canada and France on July 7. \"Battlefield\" was released as a maxi single in Germany on July 17.\n= = Composition = =\n\"Battlefield\" is a mid-tempo pop and R & B ballad. It also derives from the genres of pop rock and soft rock. The instrumentation of \"Battlefield\" consists of a bass, piano, drums, percussion and guitar. \"Battlefield\" is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major with Sparks' vocal range spanning from the note of A3 to C6. The song's lyrics revolve around \"a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise\", as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that \"Battlefield\" is based on the \"love is war\" metaphor. During the chorus, Sparks sings: \"I never meant to start a war / You know, I never wanna hurt you / Don't even know what we're fighting for / Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield.\" Its bridge features the line: \"I guess you'd better go and get your armour\".\n= = Critical reception = =\nBill Lamb of About.com awarded \"Battlefield\" four-and-a-half out of five stars, writing, \"'Battlefield' is the kind of song that screams instant hit from the first time you listen [to it].\" Lamb also praised Sparks' \"exciting, declaiming vocals\" and wrote that she \"is no minor talent, and she proves it here. From the first notes she is clearly in a vocal zone.\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the song bears similarities to Beyoncé's \"Halo\" (2009), but found the song \"more bombastic, more overblown and, well, just plain better\". A writer for The Insider stated that it was one of the songs on the album that proved why she won the sixth season of American Idol. Ruth Harrison of Female First magazine called the song \"incredible\", writing, \"From the build-up of the verses to the epic chorus that is just made to be sung in arena's all over the world; the greatness of this song can really not be summed up in words.\" Adam Knott of Sputnikmusic called it \"a massive, epic pop song\", that is Sparks' best single release to date. Gavin Martin of Daily Mirror called \"Battlefield\" one of the most \"epic metaphoric ballads\" ever made by Tedder. Shereen Low of The Belfast Telegraph described it as a \"radio-friendly song\", while Ryan Brockington of New York Post called the song \"simply pure pop magic\".\nMichael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly described \"Battlefield\" as \"gorgeous\", writing, \"when Sparks hits that 'Better go and get your armor' bridge, you can practically feel the wind whipping through your hair.\" Johnny Dee of Virgin Media wrote that it was one of the song's \"you cannot help but reach for any available nearby hairbrush and sing along to\", despite calling the bridge a \"clunking pedestrian pace and corny advice\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated that \"Battlefield\" is as catchy as \"Halo\" and Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\" (2007), and noted that the song's production was similar to Pat Benatar's \"We Belong\" (1984). This was echoed by Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, who wrote that \"there's an inner Pat Benatar struggling to get out.\" Nate Chinen of The New York Times stated that on \"Battlefield\", Sparks' \"sounds vexed but in control, and undaunted by the copyright interests of Pat Benatar, who preferred her battlefield metaphors in declarative form\", referring to Benatar's \"Love Is a Battlefield\" (1983). Joanna Hunkin of The New Zealand Herald noted that the song's lyrics were similar to Benatar's \"Love Is a Battlefield\", and criticized Sparks for plagiarism and not crediting Benatar as an inspiration.\n= = Chart performance = =\nIn the United States, \"Battlefield\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 32 on the chart issue dated May 30, 2009.

On June 3, 2009, a thirty-second preview of the video was released online. The complete video premiered online on June 7, 2009. The video begins with a shot of a black car parked in the middle of a field. Sparks appears to be sitting in a car, dressed in black, as she sings the first verse. Intercut scenes of Sparks laying down in the field wearing a white dress are then shown. During the second verse, she exits the car and walks towards the camera. As the second chorus kicks in, Sparks is surrounded by smoke. During the song's bridge, she warns her love interest to get his armour, as she appears to be surrounded by flashing lights and smoke. Then intercut scenes of Sparks singing into the camera in front of a black backdrop are shown. The video then shows Sparks lifting her right arm in the air as missiles shoot up into the sky. The video ends by showing Sparks covered in smoke. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the video shows that Sparks is \"definitely growing up\". Maura of Idolator wrote that the video \"is a simple affair that allows her to get into maximum drama mode.\"\n= = Live performances and cover versions = =\nOn May 13, 2009, Sparks performed \"Battlefield\" on the American Idol top 3 results show, and accompanied by Ryan Tedder who played the piano during her performance. The performance was praised by Bob Payne of The Seattle Times, who wrote that \"Jordin looks and sounds great!\". In June 2009, Sparks became a support act for the Jonas Brothers' world tour and performed \"Battlefield\" with the band. On July 20, 2009, Sparks performed \"Battlefield\" on Good Morning America. The performance featured Sparks in a black and white dress, performing with a backup band. The following day, she performed the song on Live with Regis and Kelly and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. In August 2009, Sparks performed \"Battlefield\" during Britney Spears' North American leg of her Circus Tour, in which she served as a support act. The song was included on the set-list of her Battlefield Tour (2010).\nOn July 23, 2009, \"Battlefield\" was covered by English alternative rock band Fightstar on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Their performance of the song was included on a live DVD titled Unplugged at the Picturedrome. In May 2010, \"Battlefield\" was covered by the ABC television show One Life to Live in the musical episode \"Starr X'd Lovers\". In September 2010, contestant India-Rose Madderom sang a version of the song on the second season of The X Factor (Australia).\n= = Track listing and formats = =\n= = Credits and personnel = =\nSource:\n= = Charts and certifications = =\n= = Release history = ="

                "text": "= Māori Battalion =\nThe 28th (Māori) Battalion, more commonly known as the Māori Battalion, was an infantry battalion of the New Zealand Army that served during the Second World War. It was formed following pressure on the Labour government by some Māori Members of Parliament (MPs) and Māori organisations throughout the country which wanted a full Māori unit to be raised for service overseas. The Māori Battalion followed in the footsteps of the Māori Pioneer Battalion that served during the First World War with success, and was wanted by Māori to raise their profile, and to serve alongside their Pākehā compatriots as subjects of the British Empire. It also gave a generation of people with a well-noted military ancestry a chance to test their own warrior skills.\nRaised in 1940 as part of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), the 28th (Māori) Battalion was attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division as an extra battalion that was moved between the division's three infantry brigades. The battalion fought during the Greek, North African and Italian campaigns during which it earned a formidable reputation as a fighting force which has subsequently been acknowledged by both Allied and German commanders. It was also the most decorated New Zealand battalion during the war. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion contributed a contingent of personnel to serve in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, before being disbanded in January 1946.\n= = History = =\n= = = Formation = = =\nThe 28th (Māori) Battalion had its origins before the start of the Second World War. In mid-1939, as war in Europe began to be seen as inevitable, Sir Āpirana Ngata started to discuss proposals for the formation of a military unit made up of Māori volunteers similar to the Māori Pioneer Battalion that had served during the First World War. This proposal was furthered by two Māori MPs, Eruera Tirikatene and Paraire Paikea, and from this support within the Māori community for the idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for Māoris to participate as citizens of the British Empire and to test their warrior skills. At first the New Zealand government was hesitant, but on 4 October, the decision was announced that the proposal would be accepted and that the battalion would be raised in addition to the nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.\nNevertheless, it was decided that the battalion's key positions, including its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, it was decided that the battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer — later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940 — and that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.\nAlmost immediately effort was focused upon selecting and identifying the officers and NCOs. To this end volunteers were called for amongst units that had already formed as part of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) and from new recruits. At the end of November, 146 trainees reported to the Army School at Trentham, where even serving officers and NCOs were required to prove their suitability for positions in the new battalion. Concurrently, recruiting of men to fill the other ranks positions began in early October and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted. The process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities, and the recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35, although later married men were allowed to join, but only if they did not have more than two children of similar ages.\nOn 26 January 1940 the battalion came together for the first time, marking its official raising at the Palmerston North Show Grounds. Upon formation it was decided that the battalion would be organised upon tribal lines. The unit consisted of a headquarters company and four rifle companies, designated 'A' through 'D': 'A' Company was recruited from North Auckland; 'B' Company from Rotorua, the Bay of Plenty and Thames – Coromandel; 'C' Company from the East Coast from Gisborne to East Cape and 'D' Company from Waikato, Maniapoto, Hawkes Bay, Wellington and the South Island, as well as some Pacific Islands and the Chatham and Stewart Islands.\nFebruary saw the issuing of equipment and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short of men who were able to serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers because the majority of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.\n= = = United Kingdom = = =\nSailing upon the Aquitania via Fremantle and Cape Town, the battalion arrived at Gourock, Scotland, after six weeks at sea. Initially they had been destined to join the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East, but due to concerns about a possible invasion of the United Kingdom by the German Wehrmacht, the decision was made to divert the division's second echelon, a brigade-sized force that included the 28th (Māori) Battalion, to Britain to help bolster the island's defences.\nIn late June or early July 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was attached to a mixed brigade under Brigadier Harold Barrowclough. During this time they manned defences in the south of England and undertook further training. The battalion suffered from a lack of equipment, largely due to the priority given to re-equip British units following the losses suffered by the British Expeditionary Force in France, and consequently training was largely focused upon anti-gas procedures and route marching. On 6 July they were inspected by King George VI and he was said to have been impressed by the \"smartness of the close order and arms drill of the Māori Battalion\" and \"by the fine physique, keenness and determined demeanour\" of the men.\nShortly afterwards the Mixed Brigade began quick deployment and defensive manoeuvres in earnest, as fears of invasion grew. In between exercises, further training was undertaken and the battalion also worked to improve fixed defences throughout July and into August and September. These exercises varied in size from company to battalion-level, and involved differing scenarios and enemy forces. In September, a divisional review was undertaken and amidst massive German air raids upon London, the New Zealanders were declared to be ready for front-line service in the event of a German landing. Warning orders for deployment to Egypt were cancelled and the New Zealanders were placed under command of XII Corps, taking up defensive positions in the Folkestone – Dover region.\nIn October, the Māori Battalion was attached to \"Milforce\", under Dittmer's command, along with a squadron of tanks, a squadron of cavalry and a medium machine gun company. The following month, with an invasion now considered unlikely, the battalion returned to Aldershot for the winter, remaining there for two months. During this time limited training was undertaken, although upon invitation the battalion fielded a rugby team against a Welsh side at Langley Park, losing 12 – 3. Later in the month, the battalion received the order to begin preparing for redeployment to Egypt and an advance party was dispatched in mid-December. On 7 January 1941 the rest of the battalion left for the Middle East, embarking from Liverpool on the Athlone Castle.\n= = = Middle East = = =\nAfter sailing via Freetown, Cape Town and Durban, the Athlone Castle sailed up the east coast of Africa and entered the Suez Canal, arriving at Tewfik harbour on 3 March 1941. In the afternoon the battalion entrained and two days later they arrived in the desert, where they were met by motor transport which carried them to camp Garawi, about 20 miles (32 km) from Cairo. At this point they were met by about 300 reinforcements which were used to replace men who had been laid down with influenza and to bring the battalion up to a higher establishment. Shortly afterwards they were moved to Alexandria, where they embarked on the Cameronia, bound for Greece.\n= = = Greece = = =\nOn 6 April the German invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia began. In order to help defend Greece, a composite force of three divisions of Australian, British and New Zealand troops were to be deployed, and were grouped together under the title of 'W' Force. However, by the time the invasion began only two of the three divisions had arrived, and the New Zealanders were consequently spread thin, holding a position to the north of Katerini, where they were tasked to defend the strategic Olympus Pass to the south. During this time, the 28th (Māori) Battalion was attached to the 5th Infantry Brigade, which was later grouped with other Australian and New Zealand units to form the Anzac Corps. Vastly outnumbered, within two days the situation for the Allies was not good as the Germans had broken through the defences along the Bulgarian border and the Yugoslav resistance had collapsed. As the situation worsened, orders came down from brigade headquarters that the passes would be held \"to the last man and last round\".\nOn 9 April, the fall of Salonika precipitated the order for the battalion to withdraw from their positions at Katerini south to Olympus. As events unfolded elsewhere, the battalion remained in position, digging in and constructing defences until 12 April when they were ordered to withdraw behind the Mavroneri Gorge and reposition themselves on the western aspect. At this time the 5th Infantry Brigade's orders were changed from a holding action to a delay and withdrawal. It was in the Petra Pass, alongside the 22nd Battalion, that the 28th Battalion fought its first engagement of the war. In preparation for the coming attack, the Māoris built their position, running out barbed and concertina wire and digging in while German bombers droned overhead. During the night they carried out patrols along the Mavroneri riverbed, but no contact was made. The following morning, the divisional cavalry, which had been carrying out a rearguard action, conducted a withdrawal through the battalion's position, making the Māori Battalion the most forward Allied unit. As German forces were halted at Platamon by the 21st Battalion, thrusts towards Larisa once again put the battalion's position in doubt and they were again ordered to withdraw. Meanwhile, the Anzac Corps decided to make its last stand 100 miles (160 km) south at Thermopylae.\nIn the end the Māoris remained in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before finally they received the order to fall back. With isolated platoons still in contact with the Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3: 00 am.\nAfter meeting motor transport, the battalion moved back to Ay Dhimitrios, which they began to prepare to defend in order to help seal off the exit of the Olympus pass. The withdrawal continued, though, and on 19 April the Māori Battalion was called upon conduct a delaying action as the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade pulled back through Larisa towards Lamia, 80 miles (130 km) south. Along roads packed with vehicles and civilian traffic they withdrew amidst considerable confusion. Upon arrival at Thermopylae the battalion had had just enough time to dig in before receiving the order that they were to move their position in order to make way for the 6th Infantry Brigade. They completed this move by 21 April, taking up the same positions that Leonidas and his army had defended against Xerxes in 480 BC, according to legend. Here they took up position in a marsh and as they made preparations for its defence, on 22 April, in Athens, the decision was made that the units of the British Commonwealth forces would be withdrawn from the country.\nOver the course of the next two days, the battalion withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they went. In the confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9: 00 pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3: 00 am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.\n= = = Crete = = =\nAfter being evacuated from Greece, the Māori Battalion embarked upon the landing ship, infantry HMS Glengyle and was taken to Crete where they formed part of the island's hastily formed garrison. The 5th Infantry Brigade was allocated to the area surrounding the airfield and the battalion was positioned on the north coast at Platanias, on the brigade's right flank. On 20 May 1941, the Germans launched the opening stages of their campaign with large-scale glider and parachute drops of troops from Maleme to Canea. The landings were focused around the airfield and no troops landed in the area being held by the Māoris, nevertheless, a small force of glider troops were found to be occupying a house on the beach about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) from them. A platoon was dispatched to attack them and after a brief fire-fight in which two New Zealanders were wounded and eight Germans were killed, the 10 remaining men in the house surrendered.\nThe main German attack was focused upon the 22nd Battalion which was defending the airfield. Hard pressed, late in the day the 22nd requested reinforcements and the 5th Infantry Brigade commander, Brigadier J. Hargest, sent one company from the 23rd and one from the 28th. The task was given to 'B' Company and, as the company commander only knew the direct route, they had a night approach march of over 8 miles (13 km) to cover. During the march they came in contact with a platoon-sized force of Germans which briefly held up the company before reinforcements could arrive. The German force surrendered, but in doing so one of their number threw a grenade at the New Zealanders, wounding two men. In response the Māoris fixed bayonets and carried out the first bayonet charge by a New Zealand force during the war, killing 24. A short while later they killed another eight in a separate engagement. Continuing on towards the 22nd Battalion, they bumped into a number of small pockets of Germans before eventually linking up with the 22nd Battalion's headquarters where they were told to return to their own lines as the decision had been made to withdraw from the airfield. Eleven hours later the company reported back to the 28th Battalion's lines.\nOver the course of the next ten days the battalion was involved in a series of engagements as they fought to defend the island, with the most notable probably being the bayonet charge that they undertook with the Australian 2 / 7th Battalion at 42nd Street on 27 May in which 280 Germans were killed, with the Māori accounting for 100. However, it soon became clear that the garrison on Crete would need to be evacuated and on 28 May the bulk of Creforce began to disengage the Germans and begin the retreat towards Sfakia. The 5th Infantry Brigade took turns with two Australian battalions and the commandos of Layforce to carry out a rearguard action to guard the pass through which the troops had to traverse in order to escape.\nOn 30 May the final order was received, although due to shipping losses it was not possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.\n= = = North Africa = = =\nAfter their escape from Crete, the 28th (Māori) Battalion was evacuated to Egypt where they were re-issued with summer uniforms and began to receive reinforcements. In June they carried out a ceremonial parade for King George VI and the Queen, and the commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division, Lieutenant General Bernard Freyberg. Throughout July, the battalion undertook desert familiarisation training and sports parades before moving to Kabrit where they concentrated with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade for a three-week combined operations exercise. Later, in August, they moved to a position 20 miles (32 km) west of El Alamein, known as the \"Kaponga Box\" where throughout September and into October they undertook the unfamiliar task of road construction. In October, the brigade received orders to link up with the rest of the division in preparation for their commitment to the battle along the frontier.\nOn 11 November 1941, the 5th Infantry Brigade concentrated near Mersa Matruh. Three days later the division had assembled and began the advance into Libya. Their first task was to capture the seaside town of Sollum, which was taken on 23 November from its Italian garrison with only a few casualties. Follow-up artillery inflicted 18 killed and 33 wounded however, including the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Dittmer, and two company commanders. Two hundred and forty-seven Italian prisoners were taken. Following this, the 5th Infantry Brigade was placed under the command of the 4th Indian Division and the 28th Battalion took up positions near Bardia.\nThree days later the battalion attacked a column of tanks and motorised infantry before ambushing a column at Menastir on 3 December. Later, notable actions were undertaken at Gazala and at Sidi Magreb where over 1,000 Italians prisoners were captured. Following this, the battalion was deployed to Syria before returning to Egypt in June 1942. Now officially under the command of a Māori for the first time — Lieutenant Colonel Eruera Love having taken over from Dyer in May — the Māoris took part in the 2nd New Zealand Division's breakout from Minqar Qaim, undertaking a successful bayonet charge. At this time, the battalion's skills with the bayonet earned them a reputation as \"scalp hunters\" among German commanders, including Rommel.\nIn September and October the battalion took part in important actions as part of the offensive in the Munassib Depression and at Miteiriya Ridge during the Second Battle of El Alamein. On 2 November the battalion supported the final breakthrough by Allied forces that decided the outcome of the battle. Casualties were high during this time and three of its commanding officers were either killed or wounded between July and November 1942. Nevertheless, the battalion remained in the fighting and in March 1943, at Medenine it undertook a defensive role before switching to the offensive at Point 209 in the Tebaga Gap, where it was responsible for almost completely destroying a German panzer grenadier battalion. It was during this action that Second Lieutenant Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu performed the deeds that led to him being posthumously decorated with the Victoria Cross. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bennett, also received the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership during the attack.\nTwo weeks later, on the night 19 / 20 April 1943, the battalion took part in the 5th Infantry Brigade's attack on the Tunisian village of Takrouna. The village was situated atop a steep slope, and the attack stalled due to heavy concentrations of indirect fire and landmines, which wounded a number of men, including the commanding officer. Nevertheless, two sections under the command of Sergeant Haane te Rauawa Manahi, managed to scale the western side of the escarpment and gain a foothold on the pinnacle in the early dawn. Following heavy shellfire and hand-to-hand combat with the Italian defenders, the Māoris were forced off the pinnacle twice; each time, though, Manahi led his small force in a counterattack. In the afternoon, Manahi and two other men captured a number of machine gun and mortar positions, encircling the Italians and forcing them to surrender. For these actions, Manahi was also recommended for a Victoria Cross, but the nomination was not approved and he received a Distinguished Conduct Medal instead.\n= = = Italy = = =\nThe battalion returned to Egypt with the 5th Infantry Brigade in late-May and underwent a period of refit and retraining, during which the bulk of the original unit was given three months leave and returned to New Zealand. Following the evacuation to hospital of Lieutenant Colonel Kingi Keiha, there were no suitable senior Māori officers available and he was replaced as commanding officer by Lieutenant Colonel Monty Fairbrother on 11 September. Having taken no part in the Allied invasion of Sicily in July – August, the 2nd New Zealand Division was committed to battle again in late 1943 as part of Eighth Army during the Italian Campaign. The Māori Battalion subsequently arrived in Italy on 22 October, landing at Taranto. 5th Infantry Brigade undertook a period of training in close-country tactics, remaining in camp at Taranto until 18 November when it was ordered to move north 250 miles (400 km) to join the Eighth Army.\nThe 2nd New Zealand Division had moved into the front line in November in order to relieve the 8th Indian Division and would take part in the advance across the Sangro planned for the end of the month. The brigade subsequently occupied positions around Atessa, with the Māori Battalion in brigade reserve, occupying a series of low hills which formed the Sangro river valley. The Eighth Army's forward units had reached the Sangro in early November and General Harold Alexander — commander of the 15th Army Group — had planned for Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with V Corps. Montgomery shifted the 8th Indian Division to the right in secret to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power, bringing the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap. Heavy rain flooded the river, forcing the postponement of the offensive and giving the Germans time to move in reinforcements. In the early hours of 28 November the Eighth Army attack began, supported by heavy artillery concentrations. The New Zealanders advanced steadily, capturing the bulk of their objectives. The Māori Battalion, still in brigade reserve, stood to during the attack but was not required.\nDuring December the 2nd New Zealand Division took part in the Moro River Campaign. By this time the attacking battalions had exploited forward towards the Winter Line and the Māori Battalion moved forward by truck on 1 December, crossing the Sangro. Heavy congestion on the road delayed the battalion's movements, and although scheduled to assault towards Elici, they arrived to find the 23rd Battalion and the Division Cavalry had already completed the task. The Māoris were again ordered into reserve, occupying positions 1 mile (1.6 km) east of Castelfrentano. Meanwhile, on 3 December, the 6th Infantry Brigade assaulted Orsogna, and was involved in heavy fighting there, first capturing and then losing it following a counter-attack by German armour. A subsequent attack against Orsogna was planned by the New Zealanders utilising both the 5th and 6th Infantry Brigades. The attack was scheduled for 7 December, with both brigades to advance on a one battalion front. The Māori Battalion would lead the assault in the 5th Infantry Brigade section, up the Pascuccio spur to cut the Orsogna – Ortona road east of the 6th Infantry Brigade's objective. Fairbrother planned to assault with two companies forward, one in depth and one in reserve, with support from armour and anti-tank guns. This could not be provided though, as difficult terrain prevented tracked vehicles from moving across the Moro and up on to Pascuccio.\nThe attack on Orsonga began at 3: 30 pm, following a half-hour artillery bombardment, and marked the battalion's first battle on Italian soil. Although initially some progress was made, the Germans managed to hold Orsonga throughout December amidst intense hand-to-hand fighting. Finally, the Māoris were withdrawn from the line on the night of 15 / 16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit. Over the course of the battle, they had lost 11 men killed and 222 wounded.\nThe New Zealanders were subsequently transferred to the Fifth Army for its advance up the west coast of Italy towards Rome. Leaving behind the bitter cold on the other side of the peninsula, the battalion undertook a period of training and reorganisation near Sant 'Angelo d'Alife. At this time Fairbrother was replaced by another Pakeha officer, Major Russell Young, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel and subsequently led the battalion until July 1944.\nAs part of the Fifth Army's advance up the Liri valley, the Māori Battalion's next major engagement came in early 1944 when they took part in the fighting around Monte Cassino. The position at Cassino was dominated by an historic Benedictine monastery. Throughout January the Allies continued their advance, but as they were checked by the German positions at Cassino the advance stalled. On the night of 17 / 18 February 1944, as part of an attempt to establish a bridgehead into the German lines, the Māoris were tasked with attacking the railway station in Cassino. They met very stiff resistance, and although they managed to reach the railway station they were unable to wrest control of it from its defenders. Lacking armoured support, which had failed to arrive, they fought through the morning and into the afternoon, but when their position was assaulted by two German tanks they were forced to withdraw. The two assaulting companies, 'A' and 'B', suffered over 60 per cent casualties, losing 128 men killed or wounded. In March they were again involved in fighting around Cassino, however, it was not until May that the position was eventually captured, by which time the New Zealanders had been withdrawn from the line, and transferred back to the Eighth Army.\nDue to these losses, the battalion did not return to the front until July 1944. It subsequently took part in the Allied advance towards Florence and is believed to have been first to reach the city on 4 August. During this time Major Arapeta Awatere led the battalion as its acting commanding officer after Young was hospitalised with jaundice, although he returned in late August and subsequently led them through the fighting around Rimini in September. In November, Awatere took over command substantively, and in December the battalion launched an attack around Faenza, for which its commanding officer later received a Distinguished Service Order. The winter snow set in after this and, as Allied attentions were temporarily focused elsewhere, offensive action died down. Thus, throughout January, February and into March the battalion undertook defensive duties, before being withdrawn from the line in mid-March.\nIn April 1945 the battalion returned to the front line to take part in the final stages of the war. On 1 April the battalion entered the line near Granarolo along with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade and for the next month they were involved in five main battles along the Senio, Santerno, Sillaro, Gaiana and Idice rivers as the Allies pursued the Germans back towards Trieste. It was in Trieste that the Māori Battalion's war came to an end. Their involvement in the final stages of the fighting in Italy had cost them 25 killed and 117 wounded, while losses for the entire Italian campaign were 230 men killed, and 887 wounded.\n= = = Disbandment = = =\nOn 2 May 1945 news was received that all German forces west of the Isonzo River had surrendered. While this did not officially end the fighting in Italy, it was all but over. Five days later, on the night of 7 May, the battalion received the momentous news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, and that the war in Europe was over. Nevertheless, tensions remained high and concerns about the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of Istria meant that the 28th (Māori) Battalion remained on high alert. This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River.\nFollowing this the routine of the battalion became more settled and time was found for the men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's return to New Zealand. The war with Japan continued however, and at the time it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the Pacific. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.\nThroughout July the battalion undertook garrison duties in Trieste before the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Lake Trasimene. On 15 August 1945 news was received of Japan's unconditional surrender, ending plans for the battalion to take part in further combat in the Pacific. In September it was decided that as part of the departure of New Zealand troops from the theatre, memorial services would be held at the locations of the division's major battles. As a part of this program services were held at Cassino and Sangro and on Crete, while smaller parties were sent to Coriano Ridge, Faenza, Forli, Padua, Monfalcone and Udine.\nThe last batch of long service men had departed shortly after the battalion's arrival at Lake Trasimene, and so after this it was decided that the battalion would return to New Zealand as a formed unit. As such their return was to be delayed and so they found winter quarters in Florence. At this time it was decided that men from the battalion would be included within the New Zealand contribution to the occupation of Japan. In this vein, a 270-strong contingent from the battalion was sent to Japan under the designation of 'D' Squadron, 2nd Divisional Cavalry Battalion, under the command of Major J.S Baker. Finally, on 6 December the battalion entrained at Florence and embarked on the troopship Dominion Monarch at Taranto on Boxing Day. Passing through the Suez Canal, they sailed via Fremantle, arriving in Wellington on 23 January 1946, where they were met by the acting Prime Minister, Walter Nash, at Aotea Quay for an official Māori welcome home ceremony. Afterwards the men were sent back to their homes and the battalion was disbanded.\nThroughout the course of the war, 3,600 men served in the battalion. Of these, 649 were killed or died of wounds while another 1,712 were wounded. Another 29 died as a result of service following discharge, while two were killed by accident during training in New Zealand. The Māori Battalion's service against the Germans in North Africa earned them a distinguished reputation. Such was the respect that Allied commanders had for the Māori Battalion that they were frequently used as a spearhead unit. Bernard Freyberg, the General Officer Commanding of the 2NZEF, commented, \"No infantry had a more distinguished record, or saw more fighting, or, alas, had such heavy casualties, as the Maori Battalion.\" The battalion's reputation was also acknowledged by their opponents. Some sources state that the Afrika Korps commander, Erwin Rommel remarked, \"Give me the Maori Battalion and I will conquer the world\". Although, other sources attribute this comment to Rommel's former chief of staff, General Siegfried Westphal, who met with the former Māori Battalion chaplain, Reverend Canon W. T. Huata, during an Afrika Korps reunion dinner in Mainz, Germany, in 1972.\n= = Decorations = =\nIn total, the Māori Battalion received more individual bravery decorations than any other New Zealand battalion. One member of the battalion, Second Lieutenant Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu, was awarded the Victoria Cross during the war, while another member, Sergeant Haane Manahi, was also recommended for the award. During the fighting around Takrouna in 1943, Manahi led a section of men up a sheer limestone escarpment to capture a number of Italian positions; the following day he set out to capture Italian outposts. Four generals, including Harold Alexander, Bernard Freyberg, Howard Kippenberger and Bernard Law Montgomery had recommended that Manahi receive the Victoria Cross but this recommendation was downgraded in London to the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\nIn 2000, iwi Te Arawa lodged a claim with the Waitangi Tribunal for Haane Manahi to have his award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal upgraded to a Victoria Cross. In December 2005 the Waitangi Tribunal released their findings supporting the claim, but in October 2006 the New Zealand Minister of Defence announced that the award could not be made as King George VI had ruled in 1949 that no further awards from the Second World War ought to be made. Instead, it was decided that Manahi would be recognised by the presentation of an altar cloth, a personal letter from Queen Elizabeth II acknowledging his gallantry and a sword. The award was presented to Manahi's son by The Duke of York on 17 March 2007 at a ceremony in Rotorua.\nOther awards to members of the 28th (Māori) Battalion included: seven Distinguished Service Orders; one Member of the Order of the British Empire; 21 Military Crosses and three bars; and 13 Distinguished Conduct Medals; 51 Military Medals; one British Empire Medal and one US Silver Star.\n= = Battle honours = =\nThe following is a list of battle honours received by the 28th (Māori) Battalion:\nSecond World War: Olympus Pass, Crete, El Alamein, Tebega Gap, Takrouna, North Africa 1942 – 43, Orsogna, Cassino 1, The Senio, Italy 1943 – 45, Mount Olympus, Greece 1941, Maleme, Canea, 42nd Street, Withdrawal to Sphakia, Middle East 1941 – 44, Tobruk 1941, Sidi Azeiz, Zemla, Alem Hamza, Mersa Matruh, Minqar Qaim, Defence of Alamein Line, El Mreir, Alam el Halfa, Nofilia, Medinine, El Hamma, Enfidaville, Djebibina, The Sangro, Castel Frentano, Monastery Hill, Advance to Florence, San Michele, Paula Line, Celle, Saint Angelo in Salute, Santerno Crossing, Bologna and Idice Bridgehead.\n= = Commanding officers = =\nThe following is a list of the 28th (Māori) Battalion's commanding officers:\nLieutenant Colonel G.

A deputy leader and a senior and a junior whip were also elected. Following the Labour Party's loss in the 2011 general election, leader Phil Goff and deputy leader Annette King resigned, prompting the leadership election, which was conducted as a secret ballot of the Labour caucus.\nDavid Cunliffe, David Shearer and David Parker stood for the leadership, and Nanaia Mahuta and Grant Robertson contested the deputy position. Cunliffe and Mahuta ran as a ticket. During the campaign Parker pulled out of the race and endorsed Shearer. Shearer and Robertson won the votes for their respective positions. Chris Hipkins and Darien Fenton were chosen as the senior and junior whips, respectively.\n= = Background = =\nAt the 2008 general election, the Fifth Labour Government, led by Helen Clark, was defeated by John Key's National Party. Following Clark's election-night resignation, Phil Goff was unanimously elected as the party's leader, with Annette King as deputy, and Darren Hughes and Steve Chadwick as the senior and junior whips, respectively. The party lost more support in the 26 November 2011 general election; its popular vote dipped to 27% – its worst-ever result under the mixed-member proportional representation system – and its number of MPs was reduced from forty-three to thirty-four. On 29 November 2011, Goff and King announced their resignations, effective 13 December. New whips also had to be chosen because Rick Barker (who replaced Hughes as the senior whip in April 2011, following Hughes leaving Parliament) and Chadwick were not re-elected to Parliament.\n= = Candidates = =\nFormer Cabinet ministers David Cunliffe (MP for New Lynn) and Nanaia Mahuta (Hauraki-Waikato) ran as a ticket for the leadership and deputy leadership, respectively. Former minister and list MP David Parker and Mount Albert by-election, 2009 winner David Shearer were candidates for the party leadership, and Wellington Central representative Grant Robertson sought the deputy leadership. Shane Jones considered standing for the deputy leadership, but in the end did not run. Parker stated his preference for Robertson as deputy leader. Shearer did not indicate a preferred deputy.\nShearer was viewed as unlikely to win the election; Claire Trevett of The New Zealand Herald originally expected that only Cunliffe and Parker would run for the leader's role, and The Dominion Post's Vernon Small wrote that \"Mr Shearer's bid is seen as a way to lift his profile\". Political commentator Bryce Edwards said that Cunliffe was the more appealing candidate to the public, and described Parker and Robertson as \"sort of Phil Goff clones\".\n= = Campaign = =\nLabour Party president Moira Coatsworth stated that the leadership contest would be a \"robust contest of ideas\", and suggested to the party's caucus that a series of meetings with party members be held around New Zealand. These were held from 6 to 11 December in six major cities — Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Auckland. The party membership was then encouraged to give feedback to the party caucus, who would vote in the election. On 30 November Cunliffe, Parker and Shearer were interviewed by Mark Sainsbury on the current affairs programme Close Up. The television show held a text message poll in which viewers voted for their preferred leader of the party. Over 7,500 people took part; Shearer received 50% of the support, Cunliffe 31% and Parker 19%. The following day, Parker pulled out of the leadership race and put his support behind Shearer. Shearer and Cunliffe were interviewed by Guyon Espiner on political talkshow Q + A on 4 December. During the interview, both candidates indicated their support for the introduction of a capital gains tax, which was a key part of Labour's tax policy during the 2011 general election campaign. Both also disagreed with the 2008 Employment Relations Amendment Act (90-day workplace trial), and wanted New Zealand to invest further in research and development; Shearer mentioned striving for a more green economy. On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe.\n= = Outcome and aftermath = =\nThe election took place on 13 December 2011 and comprised a secret ballot of the thirty-four Labour caucus members, meaning a candidate had to receive the support of eighteen MPs to win. Shearer was elected the party leader, Robertson the deputy leader, Chris Hipkins the senior whip and Darien Fenton the junior whip. Upon election, Shearer stated, \"I am a fresh face for Labour and I represent a fresh start for New Zealand.\" Espiner reported that Shearer received about twenty-two of the thirty-four votes for the leadership position, and a 3 News source claimed a similar number; however, Coatsworth stipulated that the election was secret and that she was the only person who had access to the ballot papers, which were destroyed. Robertson and Jacinda Ardern publicly supported Shearer, and Carmel Sepuloni backed Cunliffe.\nOn 19 December, Shearer announced a reshuffle of the Labour front bench — Parker replaced Cunliffe in the finance portfolio and number three ranking, Ardern took the number four spot as social development spokesperson, while Cunliffe moved down to number five and gained the economic development portfolio. Clayton Cosgrove (number six) became responsible for state owned enterprises and commerce, Jones (number seven) took regional development and fisheries and Mahuta (number eight) picked up education. Shearer himself took the science and innovation portfolio, while Robertson was made environment spokesperson."

He contacted Senator Nick Xenophon of Australia, who quoted statements by Saxton about Scientology into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate in November 2009. That speech caused a furor according to the The Courier-Mail, The New Zealand Herald and other media.\n= = Biography = =\n= = = Scientology official = = =\n= = = = Australia and United States = = = =\nA New Zealander, Aaron Saxton's parents were Scientologists. Saxton's father committed suicide when he was 14, and this had a significant impact on him. At age 15 he joined the Scientology group called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organisation. After joining Scientology staff, Saxton moved to work with the organisation in Sydney, Australia. Saxton's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old. Saxton was assigned to become a security officer for the organisation. According to Saxton staff in Scientology were not given sufficient drugs or medical attention, and so he removed his own teeth without usage of medication for pain.\nSaxton received influential positions within the organisation, both in Sydney and the United States. Senator Nick Xenophon stated that Saxton \"rose to a position of influence in Sydney and the United States\" within Scientology. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Saxton \"rose to a senior level\" within the Sea Org, 3 News characterised the Sea Org as \"Scientology's senior management\". The Editor-in-Chief of The Village Voice reported that Saxton served as \"one of the Sea Org's ruthless enforcers during the 1990s\". In their book Cults and New Religions, Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley describe the Sea Org writing, \"Described by the Church as' a fraternal religious order, 'members of the Sea Org' occupy the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy '.\" Rolling Stone wrote, \"Sea Org members staff all of the senior ecclesiastic positions in the church hierarchy\". In 2010, there were 5,000 members in the Sea Org.\nBetween 1989 and 1996, Saxton worked for the Church of Scientology of Australia, as well as at the headquarters of Scientology in the U.S. In 1991, Saxton was assigned to work at Scientology facilities in Florida. While in the Sea Org, Saxton spent the majority of his time assigned to Scientology facilities in Los Angeles. While in Los Angeles, Saxton worked at the division of International Management for Scientology. He also functioned within the organisation as an Ethics Officer, and worked out of the Communications Office.\nIn this role, Saxton learned policies relating to Scientology's Flag Organization and its Office of Special Affairs. While a member of the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO), Saxton tried to make sure those under his supervision had adequate nourishment. As a recruiter for the CMO, Saxton tried to get Scientologists between ages 13 to 14 to join the organisation. Saxton left Scientology in 2006. He came to question why he had done some of the actions within the Sea Org that he later came to regret. He felt ashamed for what he had witnessed, as well as the part he played in controversial acts in the organisation.\n= = = = Whistleblower against organisation = = = =\nIn 2009, Saxton lived in Perth, Australia, and worked as an information technology contractor. He contacted Senator Nick Xenophon of Australia, who read statements by Saxton about Scientology into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate. In a November 2009 speech, Xenophon said, \"Aaron has now left the organisation and is willing to cooperate with police investigations into these matters.\" Senator Xenophon characterised Saxton as a \"victim\" of Scientology that had written to him about the organisation. Saxton's statement was tabled in Australian parliament.\nXenophon said, \"In his statement Aaron also says he was forced to participate in the illegal confinement and torture of a follower who was kept under house arrest.... He says while under control of Scientology he was involved in coercing female followers to have abortions (because)... this was in line with a policy designed to keep followers loyal to the organisation and to allow them to keep working for the organisation.\" He read into the record, \"Aaron says women who fell pregnant were taken to offices and bullied to have an abortion. If they refused, they faced demotion and hard labour... Aaron says one staff member used a coat-hanger and self-aborted her child for fear of punishment. He says she was released from the organisation and the files were destroyed.\" Saxton said that while a member of the Scientology organisation, he had participated in actions including torture and blackmail. He stated that Scientology members deemed to be underperforming in their tasks were ordered to eat rations of beans and rice.\nAccording to Xenophon, Saxton said he had participated in the \"forced confinement and torture\" of a woman in Scientology who had been relocated to a rural area in New South Wales. Senator Xenophon stated Saxton was, \"ordered by superiors to remove documents that would link a Scientology staff member to murder\". While an official for Scientology, Xenophon stated Saxton had \"ordered more than 30 people to be sent to Scientology's work camps, where they were forced to undertake hard labour\". While in the organisation, Saxton had access to Auditing files on celebrity Scientologists, and he was later critical of the way information from these files could be used as leverage.\nIn response to the statements by former Scientologists read into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate by Senator Xenophon, the Australian PM Kevin Rudd said he would ponder opening an inquiry into Scientology. The Prime Minister called the concerns raised in the statements by former Scientologists including Saxton \"grave\", and stated, \"Many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology. I share some of those concerns. But let us proceed carefully, and look carefully at the material which he has provided, before we make a decision on further parliamentary action.\" Senator Xenophon said that Saxton had been in touch with the office of the Prime Minister, and had offered to provide additional statements and testimony regarding the assertions made in the Australian Senate. In March 2010, Xenophon's call for an inquiry was \"overwhelmingly rejected\" by the Australian Senate, the senators voting 33 to 6 against, with 37 abstentions.\n= = = = Scientology response = = = =\nScientology in November 2009 said that Saxton's letter to Senator Xenophon was not reliable. The Church of Scientology released a statement in 2009 referring to Saxton as \"a mean hateful young man\". The head of Scientology in New Zealand, Mike Ferriss, characterised Saxton as a \"nutter\" and a \"consummate liar\". In a statement given by Ferriss to Campbell Live, he said, \"There are no forced abortions in Scientology and if Aaron Saxton or anyone else coerced someone into having an abortion then they are way outside of the Church's policy and ethical conduct.\"\nIn February 2010, Scientologist Sue Hunt tried to get an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) filed against Saxton. Hunt said Saxton had banged on her car window during a protest against Scientology. Saxton said that he did not know the individual. According to Today Tonight, \"Scientologist Sue Hunt completed a course called 'PTS / SP'. This course is designed to teach Scientologists how to attack, intimidate, harass, even lie about anyone or any group that criticises Scientology.\" Saxton said that the AVO was an attempt to suppress his right to freedom of speech. Magistrate Paul Falzon questioned the legitimacy of Hunt's assertions, and said the court would require demonstration of \"reasonable apprehension\" of a threatening or violent action. \"Have you seen what happens to Nicole Kidman?\", queried the Magistrate regarding Hunt's assertions.\nSenator Xenophon spoke out critically about Scientology's actions against Saxton, and referenced the practice of Fair Game. \"Since Aaron has spoken out he says he's been harassed at work, his mother's been visited by private investigators, he's been getting a number of unexplained phone calls to his private number and you've got to ask the question has this got anything to do with the Scientology doctrine of Fair Game? Let me just quote you what L Ron Hubbard said about it. He said Scientology critics can be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed. They are the words of the founder of Scientology,\" said Senator Xenophon.\n= = Commentary = =\nThe Courier-Mail called Saxton a whistleblower against Scientology, and 3 News said that Saxton's \"whistleblowing about the Church has made it all the way to the Australian Parliament\". The New Zealand Herald described the statements given to Senator Xenophon by Saxton as \"at the centre\" of the Senator's speech in the Australian Senate criticising Scientology. The New Zealand Herald commented, \"Saxton's allegations about behind-the-scenes church activities caused an uproar after they were quoted in the Australian Senate\", and reported that Saxton's statements \"formed part of a blistering attack in the Australian Senate\". The Australian current affairs program, produced by the Seven Network, Today Tonight, described Saxton's revelations as \"shocking\". Today Tonight commented, \"He joined a group of former Scientologists in revealing stunning, shocking claims of abuse, tabled by federal independent Senator Nick Xenophon.\" The Editor-in-Chief of The Village Voice stated that Saxton's statements comprised \"some of the most cited after Xenophon's speech\", and commented, \"Saxton's profile in Australia blew up overnight after Xenophon's speech, and his story quickly became familiar there\"."

                "text": "= Cris and Cru Kahui homicides =\nThe deaths of brothers Christopher Arepa and Cru Omeka Kahui (20 March 2006 – 18 June 2006), two New Zealand infants from a Māori family who died in Auckland's Starship Children's Hospital after being admitted with serious head injuries, highlighted the fact that Māori children are more than twice as likely to die as a result of abuse than non-Māori and that New Zealand ranks fifth highest among OECD nations for child deaths due to maltreatment according to a 2003 UNICEF report.\nTheir family initially refused to cooperate with police in the homicide investigation into the children's deaths. The father, 21-year-old, Christopher Sonny Kahui was charged with their murder. His defence was that the mother was responsible for the deaths. After a six-week trial, the jury took just one minute to acquit him.\nA coroner's report released in July 2012 concluded that the children's injuries occurred \"whilst they were in the sole custody, care and control of their father\".\n= = Before deaths = =\nChris and Cru Kahui were the two survivors of triplets born prematurely at 29 weeks on 20 March 2006 at the National Women's Hospital in Grafton, New Zealand. They spent six weeks at the Kidz First neonatal intensive care unit at Middlemore Hospital. During this time, nurses and social workers at the facility had informally raised concerns with a Department of Child, Youth and Family Services worker, as the parents, Chris Kahui and Macsyna King, did not spend a lot of time with the babies. According to the hospital, parents not visiting is not considered child abuse, but was a \"cause for concern\".\nBecause the infants were still technically patients of Middlemore Hospital, hospital workers regularly visited the family home. During their last visit to the hospital, Chris and Cru were reported to be healthy and well-fed. However, an autopsy showed that the infants had suffered fractured ribs in an incident prior to the fatal injuries.\n= = Deaths = =\nOn 13 June, the infants' mother, Macsyna King, returned to the house after being away overnight. She found that the boys suffered extensive bruises, and that their grandfather, William \"Banjo\" Kahui, had performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on them. Police said the grandfather was not the only person in the house at the time. According to former MP John Tamihere, a member of the Kahui extended family had said \"a young relative\" was caring for the babies the day they were fatally injured. King and her husband took their children to the family G.P., who ordered immediate hospitalisation for the infants. The Coroner made a finding that Chris Kahui refused to take the children to hospital, running away from the family car and leaving a distraught Macsyna King carrying two babies in their carriers into the hospital on her own. Doctors immediately discovered that the infants had serious brain injuries. After the infants were transferred to Starship Hospital, hospital workers notified the police. The Kahui infants were ultimately taken off life support, with Cru being the first to die at 5 a.m. on 18 June. Chris died at 6: 45 p.m. later in the day. The deaths resulted in an initial serious assault investigation by the New Zealand Police before charges were upgraded to homicide.\nBoth infants had suffered skull fractures from blunt force trauma and Chris Kahui had a broken femur. An orthopaedic specialist told The Sunday Star-Times that in order to break the femur of a baby, the bone would have to bend at a 90 degree angle, ruling out an accidental cause of the injury.\nThe bodies were released to the family on 21 June and taken to the Manurewa marae for a tangihanga (funeral rites). They were buried at the Manukau City cemetery on 24 June.\nWhile the infants were in hospital, Child, Youth and Family removed a 12-month-old brother Shane and their female cousin Cayenne, aged six months from two rented Housing New Zealand homes — one in Clendon, the other in Mangere — where the Kahui babies had lived. Police said they were treated in hospital for injuries resulting from \"neglect\". They had been found to be malnourished and \"dirty\". According to the Herald on Sunday newspaper, the two children were to be returned to the family in September 2006. But neither the parents or so-called \"Tight 12\" of family members who initially refused to cooperate with police, would be their caregivers.\n= = Homicide investigation = =\nThe police believe that, while the infants were in hospital prior to their deaths, the family was uncooperative with any investigation. Pita Sharples, the co-leader of the Māori Party, said the family had agreed to talk to police on 26 June, but this did not happen. Following the deaths, Sharples said he was disgusted by the Kahui family's behaviour. He claimed some members of the family were more interested in going \"to the pub and have a drink\" than coming forward to police. Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was \"absolutely shocking\" for the family to hide behind the funeral while everyone in the country was \"shocked and revolted\" by the injuries. There were even reports that gang members were threatening the Kahui family in utu (or revenge) over their refusal to speak.\nAfter refusing to speak to police in the week after the death, police went to family homes on 27 June. At least four family members, including the children's mother and aunt, were escorted to police stations. By 4 July, at least 20 extended family members were questioned, as well as 90 medical practitioners and staff who were in contact with the babies. Forensic scientists removed items such as clothing from the Kahui homes. By September, police said that the family was no longer \"stone-walling\" their inquiries, but a prima facie case had yet to be established. Sunday News reported on 17 September that the list of suspects was down to three and an arrest was imminent. This was followed by a police statement nine days later stating that they now knew who was responsible for the deaths. However, other family members could still be charged with related crimes.\nTwo half-sisters of the infants' mother Macsyna King, appeared on TVNZ's Sunday 23 July episode. They claimed that Macsyna and her brother, Robert King, had told them the name of the killer. TVNZ censored the name when one of the women said it, but the gender was revealed to be male. The infants' paternal grandmother, who appeared the next day on TV3's Campbell Live, contradicted this information, stating that the killer was female.\nThe homes where the babies lived were also home to at least nine adult occupants, eight of whom were on some form of social welfare. They may have been receiving payments totalling between $845 and $1395 a week, depending on their age and circumstances. Work and Income New Zealand launched an investigation to see whether all the payments were legitimate. Two instances of substantiated benefit fraud were found for one individual. The Clendon house had been occupied for two to three months, but neighbours had not noticed that babies were living there. According to the neighbours, Tuesday and Thursday nights were \"party nights,\" as this was when benefit payments were received. Loud music and fighting were often heard. One neighbour said that a sixteen-year-old female appeared on their doorstep at 3: 30 a.m. one morning after she said an older man at the Clendon house attempted to sexually assault her.\n= = = Murder arrest = = =\nThe 1 October edition of the Sunday Star-Times newspaper published an interview with the infants' father, Chris Kahui. Kahui said that he did not kill his sons, but if Police could not find anyone else, \"I go down for something I didn't do\". Investigators called Kahui's interview with the police on 3 October a \"major development\".\nOn 26 October, a \"carload of detectives\" had gone to several addresses looking for Chris Kahui, who was brought in for questioning. At 10 p.m., it was announced in a press conference that a 21-year-old man had been arrested and charged with the murder of the infants, and would appear in the Manukau District Court the next day. No other family members faced charges with relation to the deaths.\nContrary to this, the Sunday News reported on 31 December 2006 that, according to an unnamed source, a second arrest was expected. Neither the exact charges that would be laid nor the relationship of the person to the infants were revealed. Three weeks later the same newspaper said four people involved in the investigation had been summoned to the appear at the Manukau district court on 24 January. Sources told the newspaper that the new charges relate to dead infants and a pre-school child. One of those to be charged was Macsyna King, the mother of Chris and Cru. None of these charges eventuated.\nAccording to the Herald on Sunday, the Microsoft Word file containing the press release announcing the arrest of Kahui had actually been created five days earlier, and the last edit was the day before the arrest. In the same article, the Herald reported the Police were questioning whether Kahui was actually the biological father of the infants. DNA tests later confirmed that he was the father.\n= = = Court appearances = = =\nKahui appeared in the Number One court of the Manukau District Court on 27 October for a two-minute hearing, where he was formally charged with murder. He was asked not to plead; however, outside the court, Kahui's lawyer, Lorraine Smith, said her client would \"fight the charges\". He was remanded in police custody until 10 November when he was freed on bail. A pre-depositions hearing was held 17 January.\nA second pre-depositions hearing was intended to take place on 21 March. This was so his lawyer could read 60 files of evidence collected by police, and for a medical expert from Australia to become available. This second hearing was delayed because the defence was still waiting for the medical report from Australia. The depositions hearing was finally set for 18 June, with a brief court appearance on 18 April. This date was later changed to sometime on 13 August.\nKahui was found not guilty on Thursday 22 May 2008, after only one minute of deliberation by the jury. The officer who led the police investigations into the murders, Detective Inspector John Tims, said he was \"disappointed\" at the verdict, finding \"no evidence to support a charge against any other person and that includes the mother, Macsyna King\". He acknowledged the prosecutor, who had \"said in his opening and closing address that there is no new evidence to support a charge being laid against the mother, Macsyna King\". No charges were laid against Macsyna King.\nKahui's lawyer has threatened to lodge a complaint with the Police Complaints Authority over Police handling of the prosecution of her client for the murder of Chris and Cru Kahui.\n= = Coroner's report = =\nCoroner Gary Evans released a report into the deaths of the children in July 2012. He found that the twins had suffered the brain injuries which led to their deaths during the afternoon or early evening of 12 June 2006, at a time \"whilst they were in the sole custody, care and control of their father\", Chris Kahui. He said there was no evidence or fact to support that injuries being caused by the children's mother, Macsyna King. Chris Kahui, who gave evidence to the coroner's inquest, attempted to prevent the publication of the report."

                "text": "= When I Look at You =\n\"When I Look at You\" is a song by American singer-songwriter and actress Miley Cyrus. The song was written by Hillary Lindsey and John Shanks, and produced by Shanks. It was released on March 26, 2010 by Hollywood Records as the second and final single from Cyrus' first EP, The Time of Our Lives (2009). \"When I Look at You\" was featured on the 2010 romantic-drama film The Last Song and its corresponding soundtrack, being used to promote the film. The song contains an instrumentation primarily based on piano, while its lyrics speak of a dream boy.\n\"When I Look at You\" received average to mixed critical reception and was unable to duplicate the commercial success of Cyrus' previous single, \"Party in the U.S.A.\" \"When I Look at You\" peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charted within the top 30 on charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Adam Shankman. It features Cyrus playing a grand piano throughout several settings, including a beach and forest. Two other versions of the video were released: one replacing several scenes with clips from The Last Song and another featuring Bisbal. The song was included on her first world tour, the Wonder World Tour (2009).\n= = Background = =\n\"When I Look at You\" was written by Hillary Lindsey and John Shanks. It was used to promote the 2010 film The Last Song, in which Cyrus stars as Veronica \"Ronnie\" Miller, an angry, rebellious adolescent forced to spend a summer with her estranged father. The song was first included on Cyrus's 2009 extended play The Time of Our Lives and then on the film and its corresponding soundtrack. The song was initially to be included on Cyrus's 2010 album Can't Be Tamed; however, it was decided to include it on the The Time of Our Lives as well as The Last Song because it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings \"When I Look at You\", she thinks of family and love. \"It's kind of what this movie is all about\", she said. A remix version titled \"Te Miro a Ti\", featuring Spanish singer David Bisbal was released later; in it, Cyrus sings her lines in English, while Bisbal's are mingled in both English and Spanish.\n= = Composition = =\n\"When I Look at You\" is pop song with a length of four minutes and eight seconds. According to Katie Byrne of MTV News, the song is a power ballad. The song is set in 34 time and has a moderate tempo of 138 beats per minute. It is written in the key of G-flat major and Cyrus's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to E5. The song begins with piano in its intro and then transitions to Cyrus singing in a hushed tone. She begins to belt towards the second verse and an electric guitar solo follows the second chorus, showing the influence of country music on the song. It follows the chord progression E ♭ m – G ♭ – D ♭ – C ♭ – C ♭. Jocelyn Vena, also of MTV News, interpreted the lyrics of \"When I Look at You\" to be about Cyrus' dream boy. According to Byrne, the last line — \"You appear just like a dream to me\" — is very fantasy-like.\n= = Reception = =\n= = = Critical reception = = =\nReception from contemporary critics for the song has been average to mixed, with Variety magazine's Lael Lowenstein calling it an \"almost inevitable hit single\" and Allmusic's Heather Phares noting that \"When she lets her... ballad-singing diva come to the fore, Cyrus really shines.\" Phares added, \"She is just as accomplished on the EP's ballads\". Bill Lamb of About.com disagreed and stated, \"the two ballad songs, 'When I Look At You' and 'Obsessed,' feel like throwaways. Miley Cyrus did have a big hit with the highly inspirational 'The Climb,' but the ballads here flush out the distinctiveness in her voice and simply feel ordinary.\" Michael Hann of the English newspaper The Guardian referred to \"When I Look at You\" as one of the \"inferior ballads\" on The Time of Our Lives. The song won the 2010 Teen Choice Award for \"Choice Music: Love Song\".\n= = = Chart performance = = =\nIn the United States, on the week ending January 23, 2010, \"When I Look at You\" debuted at number 88 on the Billboard Hot 100. On the week ending April 17, 2010, \"When I Look at You\" ascended to its peak at number 16, from its previous position at number 25, on the Billboard Hot 100. The song peaked at number 18 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Chart. The song first appeared on the Canadian Hot 100 at number 59 and peaked at number 24. As of June 2013, \"When I Look At You\" has sold 1,319,000 copies in the United States.\nThe song also made moderate success in Australia and New Zealand. The song entered the Australian Singles Chart at number 50 and, after three weeks of ascending the chart, reached its peak at number 19. In New Zealand, \"When I Look at You\" debuted and peaked at number 27. The song debuted at number 79 on the UK Singles Chart. On the week ending April 1, 2010, it debuted and peaked at number 45 on the Irish Singles Chart. In mainland Europe, \"When I Look at You\" peaked at number 23 on the Belgian Tip Singles Chart (Wallonia) and number 49 on the Swiss Singles Chart.\n= = Music video = =\nThe music video for \"When I Look at You\" was directed by Adam Shankman, producer of The Last Song. The video was filmed on August 16, 2009 in several outdoor settings in Savannah, Georgia. \"The premise of the video for 'When I Look at You' is to put together the relationships between Miley, the piano, and music, her relationship with Liam, her relationship to the song\", Shankman commented, in regards to the video's concept. He believed Cyrus and Hemsworth had \"great chemistry\" while filming The Last Song and brought it into the set of the video. The video opens by showing a black grand piano alone on a pier, which transitions to a close-up of Cyrus with her wavy hair styled loose. She is shown playing the piano in a long white dress. Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, who portrays Will Blakelee in The Last Song, appears next to the piano, Cyrus not being present. Throughout the rest of the video, Cyrus sings and plays the piano in a forest, the beach, and a mansion's front yard. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus and Hemsworth interacting romantically, at one point kissing in a wheat field. The video ends by, again, showing the piano alone in the pier. Two alternate versions of the music video were later released: one replaces the cut-scenes of Cyrus and Hemsworth with clips from The Last Song, and another for the song's remix featuring Bisbal. The latter version replaces cut-scenes with shots of Bisbal signing in a forest and beach; his scenes were directed by Marc Roussel.\nThe video was officially premiered on February 21, 2010 on ABC Family, but was previously leaked to the Internet on September 11, 2009. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News congratulated Shankman for capturing romance in the video. She further commented, \"Cyrus is definitely growing up, something she's wanted to prove to the world for a while now. And although there's nothing particularly jarring in the clip, the vibe shows that Cyrus is most certainly ready to leave Hannah Montana behind.\" Jefferson Reid of E! reviewed the version where clips from the film are used, and said the clips made production values high, \"but also helping to keep things easy on the eyes\".\n= = Live performances = =\nCyrus performed \"When I Look at You\" at the 2009 Wonder World Tour, her first world tour. She performed the song at each venue during the tour, wearing a black dress with tail that extended below her knees. The performances began with large video screens surrounding the stage displaying The Last Song's trailer; the trailer premiered the on September 14 concert in Portland, Oregon, at the Rose Garden Arena, the Wonder World Tour's opening night. Cyrus then emerged from the bottom of the stage while playing a white grand piano, sitting on a bench. Midway through the song, Cyrus stood up and continued performing while the video screens were brought down to Cyrus' height. Cyrus described the performance as a \"sneak preview\" of The Last Song, adding that her excitement about the life imitating art scenario she experienced while filming The Last Song led her to show the movie on tour. Melinda M. Thompson of The Oregonian believed that by playing the piano at the opening night's performance of \"When I Look at You\", Cyrus \"showcased her many talents and proved she really just beginning to grasp her star power.\" Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times attended the September 22 concert in Los Angeles, California at the Staples Center and commented, \"Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing.\"\nUpon its release as a single, Cyrus performed \"When I Look at You\" on the ninth season of singing competition American Idol on March 24, 2010, the same week she mentored the contestants on the show. Dressed in a long, white satin dress, she began by sitting in a bench to play the piano and later standing up to sing; the set was decorated with trees and twinkling outdoor lighting. Katie Byrne of MTV News commented, \"Cyrus seemed to take her own advice by connecting with the audience and making eye contact during the dramatic performance.\" Monica Herrera of Billboard said Cyrus, after mentoring the contestants, she \"showed them how it's really done\". Cyrus later performed the song on MSN Movies. Her first televised performance of the song outside the United States was at the Rock in Rio concert in Lisbon, Portugal on May 29, 2010. Cyrus was joined by David Bisbal to perform \"When I Look at You\" at the Rock in Rio concert in Madrid, Spain on June 4, 2010.\n= = Charts = =\n= = Certifications = ="

At the age of 12, she was discovered by Universal Music Group scout Scott MacLachlan, and began writing songs. In December 2011, MacLachlan paired Lorde with producer Joel Little, and within three weeks, the pair had co-written and produced all 5 songs on the EP. In November 2012, Lorde self-released the EP for free download via SoundCloud. On 8 March 2013 the record was commercially released by Universal Music Group and Virgin Records.\nAn indie rock-influenced electronica album, The Love Club EP was well received by music critics, who praised its production and compared its style to works by Sky Ferreira, Florence and the Machine and Lana Del Rey.

At the age of 13, Lorde started writing songs herself. MacLachlan unsuccessfully tried to set up Lorde with several songwriters and producers to help her with production. Ultimately, he paired Lorde with Joel Little in December 2011, when she had just turned 15. Little was impressed by Lorde's vocal performance and songwriting abilities, and he built songs with musical structures based on Lorde's lyrics.\nThe pair recorded songs at Little's Golden Age Studios in Morningside, Auckland. Lorde took inspiration from hip hop-influenced music artists, such as Lana Del Rey, during the writing process, yet criticised their \"bullshit\" references to \"expensive alcohol, beautiful clothes and beautiful cars\". Within a week, Lorde had finished recording the tracks \"Royals\", \"Bravado\" and \"Biting Down\" during a school break. The pair also recorded two other songs for the EP: \"Million Dollar Bills\" and \"The Love Club\". Lorde wrote the lyrics, while Little composed the melodies and played all the instruments, including drums, guitars and synthesisers.

Critics compared the EP's musical style to works by Sky Ferreira, Florence and the Machine and Lana Del Rey. Editor Jim Pinckney from New Zealand Listener opined that Lorde's songs are structured like short stories.\nThe Love Club EP opens with the chamber pop song \"Bravado\". Inspired by Kanye West's song \"Dark Fantasy\", it talks about Lorde's feigned confidence as she prepared to enter the music industry. \"Royals\" and \"Million Dollar Bills\" are two tracks that criticise the glamorous lifestyle of the rich; the former combines subgenres of pop, including art pop and electropop, and also incorporates R & B, while the latter is a hybrid of pop and alternative rock with hip hop influences. The title track of the EP, \"The Love Club\", discusses the befriending of \"a bad crowd\". The Love Club EP concludes with the trip hop-influenced drum and bass number \"Biting Down\", featuring \"futuristic war drum thump\".

The song features vocals from Lil Wayne and Swizz Beatz. The artists co-wrote the song with Lonny Bereal, Trayce Green, and Jason \"Poo Bear\" Boyd, with Beatz producing the track. The song was released as the lead single from Graffiti on September 29, 2009, and was Brown's first official release since his altercation with former girlfriend, Barbadian singer Rihanna. Originally known simply as \"Transformer\", it is an electro-composed song infused with hip-hop, rock, crunk, and R & B influences, while making use of robotic tones. It is lyrically about introducing someone to a life of luxury.\n\"I Can Transform Ya\" received mostly positive reviews, noting the song's club feel and catchiness. The song peaked the highest in New Zealand, at number seven, and was also certified Platinum in the country. It peaked in the top twenty of the United States, at twenty-one in Australia and Ireland. The song also charted in the top thirty in the United Kingdom, becoming a top ten hit on the UK R & B Chart.

The song was set to be the first real record that Brown had released since his altercation with then-girlfriend Rihanna at the beginning of the year. Another song \"Changed Man\", an \"apologetic ode to Rihanna\" written by Brown, and several other tracks were leaked but Jive Records said the material was old. Swizz Beatz said that Brown had recorded \"60 or 70\" songs for the album, and that \"He's got something to prove.\" Beatz also commented on Lil Wayne's contribution to the song, saying, \"\" The Wayne part is just nothing to talk about, He really showed his ass on this one. It's probably the best feature verse since the 'It's Me [Bitches]' remix. He really went in on the 'Transformer' joint. \"It was originally supposed released on September 30, 2009, but Brown stated on his Twitter that the song would be released a day early on September 29, 2009.\n= = Composition = =\nThe song, influenced by hip-hop and rock, has been described as an \"upbeat tune\", is composed of pounding drums, and features referee whistles and hand claps. It also has synthpop elements, featuring a \"synthesized guitar riff.\" Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times says the song has a robo-crunk groove. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, the song is an \"adult club track\". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that the song is one of the album tracks featuring an \"aggressive stance\" and \"club banger\" that would \"sound fantastic on the dancefloor\". The song is lyrically about introducing someone new to a luxurious life. The song makes references to the Transformers film and series.\n= = Critical reception = =\nThe song received generally positive reviews. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune gave the song a positive review, calling it a \"club banger\". Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz '\"bombastic production\", Wayne's \"energetic yet nonsensical rap\", and Brown's \"joyful, brisk vocals.\" Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says \"Brown's promise for the future is to be an altogether more interesting kind of R & B artist.\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a \"swaggering\" lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type that he has made his specialty, and called it an \"electric, brassy collaboration.\" Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song \"a brutal, tuneless hunk of industrial R & B - as musically ugly as something like' With You 'was pretty\", he said \"for that matter, this track rocks\", commenting \"Whatever you may think of him, you can't deny that Chris Brown lacks balls.\" Jude Rogers of BBC Music the song was catchy, but was one of the album's tracks that were a \"pale imitation of Justin Timberlake album tracks.\"\n= = Chart performance = =\nIn the United States, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number fifty-two. After weeks of ascending and descending the charts the single reached a peak of twenty on its eighth week on the chart, giving Brown his eighth top twenty hit in the United States.

The song was certified Platinum in New Zealand by the RIANZ and Gold in Australia by the ARIA.\n= = Music video = =\n= = = Background = = =\nThe song's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn. Kahn, who also directed the video for Brown and Ester Dean's \"Drop It Low\", said that Brown played him tracks from his album on the set, and had a clear idea of what he wanted for the \"I Can Transform Ya\" video. Kahn said,\n\"... obviously, him going in there and dancing and turning into cars and trucks is right up my alley. His interests, in terms of kung fu and special effects and science fiction and all the boy-culture stuff, it falls directly in line with what I like.\" His talent is phenomenal. I'm still struggling to try and capture that talent on film, and it's a challenge. Here's a guy who can literally do anything. If you watch this thing, he's doing nunchuck tricks, and I'm a huge kung fu aficionado, and they're mind-blowing. I've never seen stuff like that before in kung fu flicks. I would say it's like a pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it. Everything dances onscreen. Everything has movement. Everything has a certain mechanical rhythm. He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical. It's sort of a hyper-intense version of the robot. Even the transformations go directly in line with the movements. \"\nKahn also said that instead of taking the song's lyrics and being \"pretentious\" about it, he wanted to show the audience exactly what Brown was singing about, commenting, \"What if we just got ambitious and demonstrated the lyrics? The trick is to do it in a creative way. Let's try to display the lyrics and the feeling of the dance at the same time.\" On October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for \"Russian Roulette\". The photos showed several scenes, including Brown in the middle of a squadron of black storm troopers, Brown in a gray suit, and him giving a karate kick in mid-air. Another was also of Brown, Wayne and Swizz Beatz standing confidently against a white backdrop.\n= = = Synopsis and reception = = =\nThe video premiered on MTV Networks on October 27, 2009. The music video opens with Brown transforming from a black sports car, and spray painting the name of the single onto the screen, indirectly referencing his forthcoming album Graffiti. The video, set entirely on an all-white backdrop, focuses on Brown's dance moves, as Brown performs alongside hooded ninjas. Several other \"transformations\" are made in the video including from motorcycles and helicopters. Swizz Beatz appears in the clip, as well as Lil Wayne, playing an electric guitar. Transformers star Tyrese Gibson makes a cameo appearance.\nJocelyn Vena of MTV News described the video as \"glossy\" and \"fast-paced\". James Montgomery of MTV News called the video a \"shiny, sexy throwback\". Montgomery also said, \"It's a blockbuster, loaded with eye-popping special effects — the titular transformations are particularly great looking, as are the scene-to-scene transitions — and frighteningly precise pop-and-lock moves from Brown himself.\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said the clip was \"snazzy-looking\", but commented, \"it feels … kind of gross.\" BET's Sound Off Blog said, \"the visual embodies exactly what the title represents- transforming into abnormal objects while doing splits and showing off some several thick wasted PYT ’ s.\" The video's choreography and dancers resembling \"cyber ninjas\" also drew comparisons to Janet Jackson's \"Feedback\" by several critics.\n= = Charts and certifications = =\n= = = End-of-year charts = = =\n= = Credits and personnel = =\nVocals - Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, Swizz Beatz\nSongwriting - Chris Brown, Jason \"Poo Bear\" Boyd, J.Thomas, Kasseem Dean, Joeseph \"Lonny\" Bereal, Dwayne Carter\nProduction - Swizz Beatz\nMixing - Manny Marroquin, assisted by Christian Plata and Erik Madrid\nRecording - Brian Springer\nGuitar - Rayfield \"Ray-Ray\" Holloman\nMastering - Chris Bellman\nSource\n= = Release history = ="

                "text": "= Live Like We're Dying =\n\"Live Like We're Dying\" is a song written by Danny O'Donoghue, Andrew Frampton, Mark Sheehan, and Steve Kipner. It appeared as a bonus track on The Script's self-titled debut studio album, as well as a B-side for some of the album's singles. It is better known for being performed by American recording artist Kris Allen. The song serves as the lead single from his self-titled major label debut album. It was released for digital download on September 21, 2009.\nThe song received positive reviews, peaking at eighteen in the United States, and also charting on other U.S. charts, including the top ten of the Pop Songs. It also charted abroad in Canada and New Zealand. The song's accompanying music video, which takes place in a desert and features a countdown clock in conjunction with the song's meaning, was also received warmly, and according to critics, was an end to the low-budget, storyline-centered, debut music videos from previous American Idol alumni.\n= = Background = =\nThe song was originally recorded by Irish band the The Script as a bonus track for the Japanese release of their self-titled debut album and a B-side track for their debut single \"We Cry\" in Australia, Finland, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland.\nIn an interview with MTV News, Allen stated that the song had been earmarked as his album's potential single since he won American Idol back in May 2009. Allen stated, \"[The song] was actually one that we had listened to really early on, and we kind of just fell in love with it. Everyone did.\" When an interview for his cover story shared with, Idol runner-up, Adam Lambert, Allen explained, \"It's a song that has a really good message-that we only have so much time, let's make the most of it. It's definitely got one of the choruses where I can picture people rolling down the windows of their cars and singing along to it.\"\nAfter the success of the single, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said,\n\"It took a while, but it ’ s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn ’ t doing great. But I think it ’ s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I ’ m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn ’ t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that ’ s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that ’ s a testament to a good song. You don ’ t have to love ‘ em the first time you hear ‘ em. It grew on people.\"\n= = Composition = =\n\"Live Like We're Dying\" is described to be in a \"moderate pop rock\" groove, and consisting of \"shuffly\" guitar playing. The song has been referred to as \"danceable\", and the chorus as \"grooving\" and \"syncopated\". It is written in the key of C major and Allen's vocals span from G3 to A4. The song contains inspirational lyrics, as Allen gives a \"muscular\" and \"engaged\" vocal performance, and delivers the lines in a rhythmic fashion. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the song contains new-age sentiments.\n= = Critical reception = =\nBill Lamb of About.com praised the song for being an excellent first single, calling it \"possibly the best first post-American Idol single yet by an American Idol champion\" and stating that it \"could appeal to a massive audience\". He also applauded the song's \"outstanding, inspirational lyrics\" and Allen's vocal performance. Entertainment Weekly '' s Michael Slezak called the song \"a future smash hit\" and described it as \"downright verbose – packing in some sweet, new-age-y sentiments about existing in the moment, living without regret, and saying 'I love you' early and often to the people in our lives\". He stated that rather than being cliché the song's lyrics are \"winningly inspirational thanks to the conviction in Kris ’ vocals\". Yahoo! News described it as \"impressive\" and felt that Allen's version of the song \"improves on the unreleased version with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery\". Monica Herrera of Billboard said that Allen \"improves\" the Script's version \"with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery\". Herrera also stated that \"Allen still seems\" emboldened by the risks he took on Idol \"and that his fans\" should be feeling the same after hearing the first track from his November 17 debut. \"\nJames Montgomery of MTV News said that the song seemed \"tailor-made\" for him, playing on the strengths that led him to win American Idol. Montgomery also said, \"his husky, broad voice, shuffly guitar playing and genuinely sweet disposition – and wraps them in a well-worn, subtly sexy tune, full of wide-eyed, dare we say inspirational sentiments. Yet, at the same time, it's also incredibly earnest in tone.\" Misha Berson of the Seattle Times described the song as \"surprising, and maybe a little jarring at first, if you expected a ballad or a mellow groove with a spare arrangement, like some of Allen's best performances on American Idol that paved the way to his Season 8 win\". In spite of Berson's initial surprise at the song's sound, she went on to praise the single as \"very catchy, a bit inspirational\", and \"energetic\". She praised the chorus and further commended the song as \"a marked improvement over what some Idol winners have put out as their first post-show single\".\n= = Chart performance = =\nThe song debuted after its first week of availability at number eighty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100, selling 24,000 copies. It fell off the chart the following week, and remained off until it re-entered at number ninety-two on November 21, 2009. It peaked at number eighteen on the chart on the week of March 13, 2010. The song peaked at ten on the Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs) chart, becoming the first male American Idol winner to enter the chart's top ten, and the fourth winner to achieve the feat following behind Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and Jordin Sparks, respectively. The song also peaked on the Adult Contemporary, Adult Pop Songs, and Christian Songs charts at nine, three and twenty-one. As of December 2010, \"Live Like We're Dying\" has sold 1,582,000 digital downloads in the United States. The song was certified platinum by the RIAA on October 15, 2010.\nInternationally, \"Live Like We're Dying\" had limited chart presence. It peaked at number eighteen in New Zealand and number forty-one in Canada.\n= = Music video = =\nThe music video was directed by Marco Puig and filmed in a desert near Los Angeles, California. The video premiered first on AOL's PopEater on November 6, 2009. Allen told Billboard magazine, \"The video looks great. It was really fun shooting it-we shot it from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. so it was an all-night thing with no breaks. [The shoot was] set up like a digital clock, but it's huge, it's this monstrous thing-like 25 feet tall and who knows how long. I get to hold a flare, which was pretty cool. I ended up throwing it at people on set.\"\nThe video begins with Allen pulling up to a junkyard in a white pickup truck at night, with a watch hanging from his key chain. Then, Allen takes a power cord out of the back of the truck and carries it through the junkyard until he plugs it in and flips a switch to turn on a large countdown clock. As the clock reaches zero, Allen leaves and begins walking away from the camera as the sun rises. Throughout the video, Allen is shown playing both an acoustic guitar and a piano, as well as singing without any instruments.\nMichael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said that the video was \"a luxe-looking, moodily lit affair that finds the season 8 champ clad in a physique-appropriate black henley and stalking his way through an abandoned construction site featuring a giant countdown clock, a dramatic sunrise, and copious amounts of recycled plastic sheeting.\" Slezak also said that, \"the folks at 19 gave Kris the proper budget to kick off his video career – at least we finally know what the company did with the savings gleaned from hiring student filmmakers to helm Blake Lewis and Diana DeGarmo ’ s tragic first clips\". James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the video looked better and more expensive that past-first videos by American Idol alumni under 19. Montgomery also compared the video's \"artfully color-saturated frames and great expanses\" to Snow Patrol's \"Run\" clip and the Madonna, Justin Timberlake, and Timbaland's \"4 Minutes\", doing away with the \"narrative crutch most Idol champs' debuts lean on (see, for example, David Cook's' Light On '), putting the focus squarely on Allen himself.\" He also said that, \"while Allen's debut video isn't as flashy-dashy as Idol compatriot Adam Lambert's' Time for Miracles, 'it's just as good – mostly because, rather than rely on fiery explosions,' Dying 'plays it straight, showcasing Allen and his talents\", and called it \"bold\" as Allen was never shown as the \"flashy type\".\n= = Live performances = =\nAllen performed the song on Good Morning America on November 17, 2009. In addition he also performed the song on Live with Regis and Kelly, and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien to promote his album. Allen performed the song on the So You Think You Can Dance live results show December 9, 2009. Allen also performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman on December 16, 2009.

                "text": "= Battle for No.3 Post =\nThe Battle for No.3 Post (28 – 30 May 1915) was fought during the Gallipoli Campaign in the First World War, between the forces of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the Turkish 19th Division.\nThe New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was responsible for the defence of the northern perimeter of the ANZAC beach-head, holding a sector from the position known as Walker's Top down the ridge line to the sea. Part of this defence line was formed by No.1 and No.2 Posts, isolated positions in the far north that could only be approached in safety during the hours of darkness. Near the end of May 1915, the Turks started constructing a new position just inland from No.2 Post, that if left to be completed would cause problems for the New Zealanders. Therefore, it was decided to assault and capture the post. After the position was captured, it was named No.3 Post, and the New Zealanders settled in and attempted to improve its defences. The same night, the Turks counter-attacked. Surrounded and cut off from the rest of the brigade, running short of ammunition and supplies, the defending 9th (Wellington East Coast) Squadron held out for twenty-eight hours until relieved, and beat off several attempts to break through their lines. When the squadron was eventually relieved it was decided the post was untenable, and it was abandoned the same night.\nThe New Zealand Mounted Brigade's casualties during the battle were forty-two dead and 109 wounded. The exact number of Turkish casualties is not known but was around two hundred men. The New Zealand brigade went on to fight in the Battle of Chunuk Bair and the Battle of Hill 60, and was then evacuated from the peninsula before the campaign ended in December 1915.\n= = Background = =\n= = = ANZAC landings = = =\nOn 25 April, at the start of the Gallipoli Campaign, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landed at what later became known as Anzac Cove. Included in the landings was the New Zealand and Australian Division, but the division had been forced to leave part of its strength, including the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, behind in Egypt. The commanders believed there would be no requirement or opportunities for mounted troops on the peninsula. However, heavy casualties, and the lack of any other reinforcements, forced them to reconsider the decision, and the mounted troops were later dispatched to Gallipoli to serve in a dismounted role.\n= = = New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade = = =\nUnder the command of Brigadier-General Andrew Russell, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was raised in August 1914 and consisted of three regiments of mounted infantry. While the brigade had an establishment of 1,940 men, when dismounted its rifle strength was only the equivalent of an infantry battalion. Each of the brigade's regiments was formed from three squadrons, each of 158 men organised into a headquarters and four troops.\nWhen the brigade arrived in Egypt, it came under the command of the newly formed New Zealand and Australian Division. In April 1915, the division's infantry units left Egypt for an undisclosed destination, and it was not until 1 May that the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade learned about the Gallipoli landings. Four days later the brigade received news that it would also deploy, as reinforcements, to Gallipoli, but in a dismounted role without their horses. They arrived off the Gallipoli peninsula on 12 May, and disembarked at Anzac Cove. The next day, the brigade moved into the front line on the northern left flank, relieving the Royal Naval Brigade. Their trenches stretched from the Aegean Sea to Walker's Ridge, and included two outposts, No.1 Post and No.2 Post. The latter position was the beach-head's most northern position, situated only two miles (3.2 km) from Chatham's Post, which was the southernmost point. The outlying position of the two posts meant that movement between them and the main lines could only be undertaken safely at night. The brigade deployed with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the left, the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the centre, and the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the right.\n= = = Turkish forces = = =\nThe First World War Ottoman Turkish Army was badly underestimated by the Allies. During the war it would defeat forces from the British, French and Russian armies. Before the landings Gallipoli was defended by several divisions, based on infantry battalion strong-points overlooking potential landing beaches. By April 1915, the Turks had 82 fixed and 230 mobile artillery pieces on the peninsula.\nIn May 1915, the Turkish force that would confront the New Zealanders was provided by the 19th Division, comprising the 57th, 72nd and 77th Infantry Regiments, all under the command of Colonel Mustafa Kemal. Kemal was noted as \"the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side\" during the Gallipoli Campaign. How the Turks viewed the invasion can be judged by Kemal's orders to his troops following the initial landings; \"Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place.\"\nVirtually all the Turkish Army commanders, down to company commander level, were very experienced, being veterans of the Balkan Wars. But their command structure was weaker at the non-commissioned officer (NCO) level, with only one NCO in each company. One advantage that the Turkish Army had over the New Zealanders, at the time, was their hand grenades, which were not used by the British forces.\n= = No.3 Post = =\n= = = Capture = = =\nAfter an abortive Turkish attack in early May, from the middle of the month the New Zealanders observed their opponents improving their defensive positions. One position in particular was started overnight on 26 / 27 May, at the foot of the ridge that led down to No.2 Post and only 450 yards (410 m) from it. It gave the New Zealanders cause for concern, and therefore it was decided that the position must be captured and denied to the Turks.\nPlans for the assault were formed, and the task was given to the 1st (Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry) Squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, commanded by Major Percy Acton-Adams. On 28 May, the squadron was concentrated at No.2 Post and at 22: 00 left the post to capture the Turkish position. By 23: 30, after advancing along the ridge, they arrived and with only slight opposition drove off the twenty Turkish defenders at a cost of one dead and five wounded. They were followed up by the 6th (Manawatu) Squadron from the Wellington Mounted Rifles, who carried entrenching tools to improve the defences and would then garrison the position, now named No.3 Post.\nThe 6th Squadron, who had orders to \"hold the post until relieved\", started constructing defences against a Turkish counter-attack, which would not be easy as the post was surrounded on three sides by the Turks. After sunrise on 29 May the squadron was in full view of the Turks and they were engaged by small arms and artillery fire. They were forced to take cover and stop building defences. That night at 21: 00 the 6th Squadron was relieved by three troops (nine officers and ninety-three other ranks) of the 9th (Wellington East Coast) Squadron, Wellington Mounted Rifles, commanded by Major Selwyn Chambers.\n= = = Defence = = =\nChambers and his second in command, Captain Charles Spragg, immediately set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22: 00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23: 35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully and out of sight to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up to the edge of the New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.\nJust after midnight the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, commanded by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward to reinforce the 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was not strong enough to break through the Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in the thick scrub. Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to form their own defensive position in the ground between No.2 and No.3 Posts.\nAt 03: 00, just before dawn, Spragg took command of the trench in the southern sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post. He successfully deployed his men so that when the attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03: 30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the post. Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully to the north of the post. However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the post. At 06: 30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.\nThe 6th Squadron, commanded by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward to support the 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached a position on the open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.\nUnable to break through to No.3 Post during the day, the New Zealanders decided to wait for nightfall to make another attempt. At the same time the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were warned they would have to provide two squadrons to take over the defence, once the 9th Squadron had been relieved. During this time the Turks had not given up their attempts to recapture the post. At 19: 00 Chambers signalled that the \"repeated bombing of the trenches on the northern side of the post had resulted in a portion of the trenches being damaged, to such an extent that he could no longer prevent the enemy from getting in.\" This was followed ten minutes later with a message that the Turks had occupied the trenches in the north of the post. Around the same time the 6th Squadron, advancing from the south, had managed to get to within one hundred yards (91 m) of the post before being pinned down. Even though they now had fire support from a mountain artillery battery and a British destroyer, HMS Rattlesnake, they were unable to advance any further. As darkness approached the Turkish attacks lessened, and at 22: 30, covered by the 2nd and 6th Squadrons, the 10th (Nelson) Squadron and two troops from the 8th (South Canterbury) Squadron from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles managed to break through to No.3 Post. By 23: 00 the 9th Squadron's survivors had been evacuated and the Canterbury Regiment had taken over the defence of the post. An hour later the 2nd and 6th Squadrons were withdrawn back to the brigade lines. Shortly after the relief, it was decided that the post was untenable and it was abandoned. While the Canterburys were withdrawing south towards No.1 Post they were attacked by the Turks. The New Zealanders turned and opened fire, then counter-attacked in a bayonet charge, forcing the Turks to withdraw before re-occupying No.3 Post. The 9th Squadron had held out for twenty-eight hours, during which the brigade had lost forty-two men killed and 109 wounded, the vast majority from 9th Squadron. Turkish casualties were around two hundred men.\n= = Aftermath = =\nThe battle for No.3 Post seemed a major event to those involved, but in General Ian Hamilton's dispatches the fight only received a brief mention: \"On 28 May, at 9 p.m., a raid was made on a Turkish post overlooking the beach 1,200 yards north of Kaba Tepe, H.M.S.\" Rattlesnake \"co-operating. A party of 50 rifles rushed the post, killing or capturing the occupants. A similar raid was made against an enemy trench to the left of our line which cost the Turks 200 casualties, as was afterwards ascertained.\"\nThe battle for No.3 Post cost the New Zealanders forty-two dead and 109 wounded. The brigade fought another two battles at Gallipoli: the Battle of Chunuk Bair, and the Battle of Hill 60. Their involvement in these battles proved costly, and in September 1915, with a strength of only 249 men, they left the peninsula for the rest camp on the island of Lemnos. During the campaign, 4,000 men served in the brigade; 727 of those were killed and 1,239 wounded, which equates to a casualty rate of almost fifty per cent. Amongst the dead were Chambers – the commander of the 9th Squadron – and Elmslie of the 6th Squadron. Both survived the battle for No.3 Post, but not the campaign, and were killed in action in August 1915 during the Battle of Chunuk Bair. Like many other New Zealanders, neither have a known grave, and they are therefore commemorated on the Chunuk Bair Memorial. The adjacent Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery has 632 graves of which only ten men have been identified. During the 260 days of the Gallipoli Campaign, a total of 2,721 New Zealand soldiers were killed and another 4,852 wounded, out of the total 8,556 New Zealanders who took part. The exact number of Turkish casualties at Gallipoli is not known, but has been estimated at 87,000 dead, from a total of around 250,000 casualties.\nThe war between the British and Ottoman Turkish Empires ended on 31 October 1918, following the signing of the Armistice of Mudros. In November, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were selected to be part of the Allied force of occupation for the Dardanelles peninsula. During their time there they took the opportunity to look for and bury the brigade's war dead. Kemal, the commander of the Turkish 19th Division, survived the war. Following the Turkish War of Independence he became known as Atatürk (Father of the Turks) and became the first president of the new Republic of Turkey, where he is acknowledged as the nation's \"founding father\"."

The song was released on 13 September 2013 as the album's third single in Australia and New Zealand by Universal Music New Zealand, and the second in the United States and the United Kingdom by Lava and Republic Records. The track was written by Lorde and Joel Little and produced by Little, with additional production from Lorde herself. \"Team\" is a hybrid of alternative pop and electro-hop featuring synthesiser, bass and snare drum instrumentation over a handclap-based beat. Lyrically, the track is a \"tribute to her friends and country\".\n\"Team\" was generally well received by most contemporary critics, who praised its musical style, lyrical content and Lorde's vocal delivery on the track. The single garnered success on charts internationally, peaking at number 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number 3 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. In Oceania, it péaked at number 19 in Australia and debuting and debuted at number 3 in New Zealand. \"Team\" was certified platinum by both the Australian Recording Industry Association and Recorded Music NZ.\nA music video for the song was directed by Young Replicant and was released on 4 December 2013. Filmed in an abandoned building named Red Hook Grain Terminal in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the video's content was inspired by Lorde's dream of an own world for teenagers. Upon its release, the clip crashed Vevo's channel due to a high number of views. To promote \"Team\" and Pure Heroine, Lorde performed the song on several occasions, including on Late Show with David Letterman and at the ARIA Music Awards of 2013. It was later featured on a Season 10 episode of Grey's Anatomy which aired in December 2013.\n= = Background = =\n\"Team\" was written by Lorde and Joel Little while Lorde was travelling the world. The track was recorded, produced and mixed by Little at his Golden Age Studios in Morningside, Auckland, with Lorde providing additional production. The song was produced using the software Pro Tools. On 13 September 2013 \"Team\" was leaked, justifying an earlier rush out release. Within hours the audio was uploaded on YouTube and Universal Music New Zealand released the digital download single for sale in Australia and New Zealand. On 19 November 2013, the track was sent to US contemporary hit radio by Lava and Republic Records. \"Team\" was sent to US rhythmic contemporary radio on 6 January 2014.\n= = Composition = =\n\"Team\" is a hybrid of alternative pop and electro-hop.

Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine and Maura Johnston of Spin likened the chorus of the song to that of Lana Del Rey's \"Born to Die\" (2011), while Drowned in Sound's Sammy Maine compared the beats to works produced by Timbaland for Missy Elliott. Lorde's vocal range spans from B ♭ 2 to D ♭ 5. The song moves at a tempo of 100 beats per minute.\nLyrically, \"Team\" is a \"tribute to her friends and country\". During an interview with Billboard, Lorde described the song as \"her take on most modern music\" and explained, \"no one comes to New Zealand, no one knows anything about New Zealand, and here I am, trying to grow up and become a person.\" Lorde explained that the line \"We live in cities you'll never see on screen\" was \"to be speaking for the minority\" from small cities. She also expresses distaste in common contemporary popular music lyrics telling listeners to \"put your hands in the air\" through the verse \"I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air\". Writer Lily Rothman for the magazine Time commented that the lyrics \"we sure know how to run things\" in \"Team\" were a response to the lyrics \"we run things, things don ’ t run we\" in Miley Cyrus' \"We Can't Stop\" (2013).\n= = Reception = =\n\"Team\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Brenna Ehrlich from MTV News lauded it as an \"insanely catchy jam\". The AV Club critic Kevin McFarland labelled \"Team\" as a \"club-ready\" and \"sparkly thumper\", while Nathan Jolly from The Music Network simply described it \"interesting\". John Murphy, in his review of Pure Heroine for musicOMH, commended the lyrics \"I'm kinda over getting told to throw my hands up in the air\" for being catchy. Marlow Stern writing for The Daily Beast listed \"Team\" as the fifth best song of 2013.\nOn 23 September 2013, \"Team\" debuted at number three on the New Zealand Singles Chart, becoming Lorde's third consecutive top-three single in the country following number-one singles \"Royals\" and \"Tennis Court\". Recorded Music NZ certified the single double platinum due to the sales figure of over 30,000 copies in the country. \"Team\" peaked at number nineteen on the Australian Singles Chart, and was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).\nFollowing its impact on US radio stations, \"Team\" debuted at number thirty-two on the Billboard Rock Airplay, and topped the chart on 7 October 2013. It also topped the Adult Top 40, and charted at number two on the Mainstream Top 40, number two on the Hot Rock Songs and number two on the Alternative Songs. On the Billboard Hot 100, \"Team\" peaked at number six, becoming her second US top-ten hit (following her debut number-one hit \"Royals\"). The song reached over two million in sales in the US by April 2014. By December 2014, \"Team\" has sold 2.45 million copies copies in the US. The single also reached number three on the Canadian Hot 100, and was certified double-platinum by Music Canada, which denotes 160,000 downloads.\n= = Music video = =\nThe music video for \"Team\" was directed by Young Replicant. Filmed the disused Red Hook Grain Terminal in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the video was inspired by Lorde's dream of \"teenagers in their own world, a world with hierarchies and initiations, where the boy who was second in command had acne on his face, and so did the girl who was Queen\". The director explained that Lorde was one of the \"kids who have a unique look\", which fitted the clip's \"sad story\" concept.\nThe video begins with shots of the ocean; The Daily Beast's editor Marlow Stern draw comparisons between the shots to Paul Thomas Anderson's drama film The Master (2012). The scene revealed an unseen city with ruins of factories on an island and full of teens \"without any parental guidance\". On Lorde's Facebook account, she further explained that world was \"so different to anything anyone had ever seen, a dark world full of tropical plants and ruins and sweat\". Inside the ruins, she is seen as the \"self-anointed\" queen of the city's citizens in a \"blue, foliage-filled universe\". Stern compared her image to that of The Hunger Games' fictional character Katniss Everdeen. A young boy is transported to the island; following his arrival, he must joust on a motorbike to become a part of Lorde's \"team\". He loses; Lorde commented that \"sometimes the person who loses is stronger\".\nOn 4 December 2013, the video was released on Lorde's official VEVO channel on YouTube at 10 AM (New Zealand time). Upon its release, the video crashed Vevo's channel due to a high number of views. Lily Rothman from Time magazine compared the video for \"Team\" to Miley Cyrus' \"We Can't Stop\" music video for their same \"mythical settings\" – a party (\"We Can't Stop\") and an island (\"Team\").\n= = Live performances, covers and remixes = =\nOn 12 November 2013, Lorde performed several songs from Pure Heroine during the Late Show with David Letterman to promote the album, including \"Team\". The track was also performed by Lorde during the ARIA Music Awards of 2013. At the 2014 MuchMusic Video Awards, Lorde performed a Goth-influenced medley of \"Tennis Court\" and \"Team\".\nAmerican alternative rock band Local H recorded a cover version of \"Team\" at Electrical Audio in Chicago, Illinois. The Local H version was released as a single on 21 April 2014.\nJ Gramm released a remix of \"Team\" in December of 2013. Noisey gave the remix a positive review, stating that J Gramm \"turns the ballad up a notch — with some triumphant drums and overall, a more victorious feel for the stories of the cities she's dreaming up.\"\nA heavily modified, instrumental version of the song is used towards the end of the season eighteen episode of South Park, entitled Gluten Free Ebola.\n= = Track listing = =\nDigital download\n\"Team\" – 3: 13\n= = Charts and certifications = =\n= = Release history = ="

                "text": "= Thomas Ellison =\nThomas Rangiwahia Ellison, also known as Tom Ellison or Tamati Erihana (c. 1867 – 2 October 1904) was a New Zealand rugby union player and lawyer. He led the first New Zealand representative rugby team organised by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) on their 1893 tour of Australia. Ellison also played in the 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team on their epic 107-match tour, scoring 113 points, and 43 tries with the side.\nBorn in Otakou, Otago Heads, Ellison was educated at Te Aute College, where he was introduced to rugby. After moving to Wellington, Ellison played for the Poneke Football Club, and was selected to play for Wellington province. He was recruited into Joe Warbrick's privately organised Native football team in 1888, and continued to play for both Poneke and Wellington on his return from that tour. In 1892, he started to refine and popularise the wing-forward system of play, which was a vital element of New Zealand rugby's success until 1932. At the first NZRFU annual general meeting in 1893, he proposed that the playing colours of the New Zealand side should be predominantly black with a silver fern — a playing strip that would give the team their famous name of All Blacks. He retired from playing rugby after captaining the 1893 New Zealand side to New South Wales and Queensland, but continued in the sport as a coach and administrator. Ellison was the author of a coaching manual, The Art of Rugby Football, published in 1902.\nAs well as being one of the first Māori admitted to the bar, practising as a solicitor, and later as a barrister, Ellison also stood unsuccessfully for the Southern Maori parliamentary seat several times. After contracting tuberculosis in 1904, he was briefly institutionalised before dying later that year.\n= = Early life = =\nThomas Rangiwahia Ellison was born in Otakou at Otago Heads, to Raniera Taheke Ellison and Nani Weller, sometime between 1866 and 1868. He was named after his paternal grandfather, and his middle name, Rangiwahia, was given in honour of his great-uncle. Ellison was Māori: of Ngāi Tahu and Kāti Mamoe tribal heritage through his mother, and of Te Āti Awa heritage through his father. Introduced to rugby at the age of around 14 by his cousins at Otakou, Ellison later wrote of his first game:\n... we were all there for a game, and immediately started on that poor, unprotected ball (which, by the way, consisted of the bladder only). What our main object was I cannot say, but mine was to see more of that ball, and to know more about football, and, before the game was over, which did not last long, I did see more of the ball, as I ripped it in the first scrum; but my other object remained unsatisfied.\nAfter completing his education at Otakou Native School, Ellison was awarded a scholarship in 1882 to attend the famous Māori secondary school Te Aute College in the Hawke's Bay. He started playing organised rugby there, and during his final two years played in the school team that won the Hawke's Bay senior club championship. Later in life Ellison claimed that at Te Aute he learned, \"nearly all I ever knew of forward play\".\nAfter moving to Wellington, Ellison joined the Poneke Football Club in 1885. The Poneke team played junior club rugby at the time, but were promoted to the senior competition after winning all their matches that year. Following their promotion the side won the Wellington club championship each year from 1886 to 1889. Ellison was selected to play for the Wellington provincial team in 1885, and continued to be selected for Wellington until 1892. He eventually earned 23 caps — a large number for the time. Initially Ellison played as a forward or on the wing, but later played half-back.\n= = New Zealand Native football team = =\nIn early 1888 Joe Warbrick attempted to organise a private party of Māori players to tour Great Britain — later known as the New Zealand Native football team. A cousin of Ellison's, Jack Taiaroa, who had toured with the New Zealand team that travelled to New South Wales in 1884, helped Warbrick recruit players for his proposed tour. It was most likely because of Taiaroa that Ellison was persuaded to join Warbrick's Natives team. Warbrick eventually assembled a side that included both Māori and non-Māori New Zealand-born players, and several players born overseas. The final team consisted of 26 players, and toured New Zealand before departing to Melbourne. They then toured Great Britain, Australia, and finally New Zealand again — the trip lasted 14 months. Ellison played mostly as a forward throughout the tour, and played at least 83 of the team's 107 matches; including a minimum of 58 in Britain.\nEllison played all of the Natives' three internationals — against Ireland, Wales, and England. The Ireland match was the first international of the tour, two months after their arrival in the British Isles. The fixture was played at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, on 1 December 1888, with Ellison in the forwards. Ireland led 3 – 0 at half-time, but the Natives improved considerably in the second-half, scoring four tries. The third try scored was by Ellison after a counter-attack by George Williams. The try was not converted, but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the team a 13 – 4 victory. The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team, but Ireland went on to defeat Wales later that season. The match against Wales was later that month, 22 December, in Swansea. Again Ellison played in the forwards, and the Natives dominated for significant periods of the match. Ellison made several strong runs, and at one point crossed the try-line only to be carried back into play. They failed to score, however, and Wales were victorious 5 – 0 (one conversion and two tries to nil).\nOne of the most notable events of the Natives' tour occurred during the match against England at Blackheath. Owing to a dispute over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board, England had not played an international in nearly two years. This contributed to at least twelve of their team lacking international experience — however many of their players were from strong club and county sides. The match was notable for a dispute between the New Zealanders and the match referee — Rowland Hill. Early in the second half Ellison attempted to tackle the English player Andrew Stoddart, and in the process managed to rip his shorts off. The Natives' players promptly formed a circle around Stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing without being exposed to the gazes of the crowd. While this was happening one of the English players, Frank Evershed, picked up the ball and scored a try. The New Zealanders protested, believing that play had stopped after claiming Stoddart had called \"dead ball\". Hill awarded the try however, causing several of the Native players to leave the field in protest. The aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return, but not before Hill had restarted play. Ellison was very critical of Hill; particularly because Hill was also Secretary of England's Rugby Football Union. Writing after the tour, Ellison said of the incident: \"gross as these errors were, they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game, viz, refereeing at all in that game\".\nThe team was generally very well received outside London, and especially in north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote — \"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures we had to go through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted not so much on the field of play as off it\".\nThomas Eyton, one of the promoters of the tour, said of Ellison's contribution — \"His knowledge of the finer points of the game, his weight, strength and activity rendered his services invaluable.\" Ellison participated in most of the Natives' matches, scoring 113 points, and 43 tries on tour; this included 23 tries in Britain and Ireland, four in New South Wales, five in Queensland, and ten in New Zealand.\n= = Wing-forward = =\nAfter completion of the tour, Ellison continued to play for Poneke and Wellington. While playing with his club, Ellison implemented the use of a wing-forward and seven-man scrum positional system. It is not known exactly who invented the position of wing-forward, but Ellison claimed in The Art of Rugby Football that he had developed it; historian Greg Ryan claims the position was developed in northern England, and that Ellison only refined it after discovering it during the Natives' tour. The distinctive feature of wing-forward play was their role of feeding the ball into the scrum, and subsequently holding onto one of the hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to the half-back. With the wing-forward bound to the side of the scrum, the opposing half-back would then have to manoeuvre past them to tackle the player with the ball; this would increase the amount of time the half-back would have in possession of the ball before their opposite could tackle them. Ellison claimed that he devised the position while playing for Poneke after he \"... found it impossible for the smartest of referees to detect and amply penalize off-side interferences of opponents bent on spoiling my passes...\".\nRegardless of the origins of the position, Ellison was instrumental in promoting its adoption throughout New Zealand. Although it is unclear whether the wing-forward was used during the 1893 tour of Australia, by the time of the All Blacks' first Test match, played during their 1903 Australian tour, the position was engrained within the New Zealand style of play. The use of a wing-forward provoked controversy both in New Zealand, and later in the British Isles after the All Blacks toured there in 1905; wing-forwards were often accused of off-side obstruction of the opposition half-back. According to Ellison however, if the position was implemented properly, then there would be no cause for complaint. The wing-forward continued as a vital component of New Zealand rugby until long-standing complaints from the unions of the Home Nations resulted in the position being outlawed by the International Rugby Football Board in 1932.\n= = Later rugby career = =\nIn 1892, the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU — later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union) was formed by the majority of New Zealand's provincial rugby unions. Ellison was a Wellington provincial administrator, and in 1893 at the inaugural NZRFU annual general meeting proposed the playing strip for the first officially sanctioned New Zealand side — black cap, black jersey with white fern, white knickerbockers and black stockings. The white knickerbockers were eventually replaced with black shorts, and the uniform itself was based upon that worn by the Native team Ellison had toured with. The black uniform inspired the moniker All Blacks — a name which has been adopted by the New Zealand national team since their 1905 – 06 Northern Hemisphere tour.\nThe first NZRFU sanctioned New Zealand team was formed to tour New South Wales and Queensland in 1893, and Ellison was selected as their captain. Three other members of the New Zealand Natives' team were also selected for the side. Ellison played seven matches on the tour, including matches against New South Wales and Queensland. The team won ten of their eleven matches — the one loss being to New South Wales in Sydney. In addition to scoring two tries, Ellison kicked six conversions and a goal from a mark to give him 23 points for the tour — the second highest of any player. The tour was the end of his participation in the sport as a player.\nEllison's complete playing record comprised 117 matches, 68 of which were first-class games. He scored a total of 160 career points, including 51 tries. Ellison continued involvement with rugby as a provincial administrator, provincial referee, and manager. As an administrator, he proposed that players be financially compensated for wages missed while on long tours; this was in 1898 — nearly a century before rugby relinquished its amateur status. This proposal applied specifically to tours that travelled outside New Zealand; writing at the time regarding the amateur regulations, Ellison said \"I think that these laws were never intended to apply to extended tours abroad.\" In 1902 he published The Art of Rugby Football, a coaching manual on rugby that also included accounts of his experiences as a player. According to journalist Hayden Meikle the book was one of rugby's \"pioneering texts\", while Greg Ryan wrote that the book \"remains a classic work on early rugby strategy.\"\n= = Professional and personal life = =\nOutside of his involvement in rugby, Ellison was a lawyer, and was one of the first Māori admitted to the bar. He practised as an interpreter for the Land Courts and as a solicitor; later, he worked as a barrister in the practices of Brandon & Hislop in Wellingon. Ellison was also involved in politics, and stood unsuccessfully for the Southern Maori parliamentary seat several times against Tame Parata, as well as working for government consideration of Ngāi Tahu land claims. He married Ethel May Howell, a daughter of John Howell, on 22 March 1899; the couple had three children, only one of whom survived infancy, daughter Hinemura who died in 1989. In 1904 Ellison was struck down with tuberculosis, and was admitted to Porirua Lunatic Asylum before dying on 2 October that same year. Ellison was buried in Otakou, Otago Heads, following the original plan of a burial at Karori. Representatives of Ellison's parents intercepted the body in Porirua, and his wife and Public Trustee then agreed for him to be buried at Otakou. There his gravestone reads \"One of the greatest rugby footballers New Zealand ever possessed\".\nEllison's influence on New Zealand rugby is such that Māori researcher Malcolm Mulholland stated he was \"arguably the player who contributed the most to New Zealand rugby\". In 1916, when discussing the question of the greatest player New Zealand had produced, the pseudonymous \"Touchline\" wrote: \"I am prepared to say that the late T. R. Ellison... was the greatest of them all.\" He went on to say:\nWhen occasion demanded, T R. Ellison could take a place among the backs — half or three-quarter — and was a fine coach. He could not only plan out great, deep, wily, and pretty schemes, but personally carry them through to triumphant execution. He could take his place in the front of a scrummage, and hook the ball with the best of them; his tremendous strength enabled him to burst through a pack, and then, when he was clear of the wreckage, and was well in the open, he was a perfect demon.\nEllison has been inducted into the Māori Sports Hall of Fame, and in 2005 was listed as one of New Zealand's Top 100 History Makers. The New Zealand Native Football team was inducted into the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame in 2008, the first side awarded the honour.\n= = = Books and articles = = =\n= = = News = = =\n= = = Web = = ="

                "text": "= German attacks on Nauru =\nThe German attacks on Nauru refers to the two attacks on Nauru in December 1940. These attacks were conducted by auxiliary cruisers between 6 and 8 December and on the 27th of the month. The raiders sank five Allied merchant ships and inflicted serious damage on Nauru's economically important phosphate-loading facilities. Despite the significance of the island to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru was not defended and the German force did not suffer any losses.\nThe two attacks on Nauru were the most effective operations conducted by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. They disrupted supplies of phosphate to Australia, New Zealand and Japan, which reduced agricultural production in these countries. In response, Allied naval vessels were deployed to protect Nauru and nearby Ocean Island and escort shipping in the South Pacific. Small garrisons were also established to protect the two islands.\n= = Background = =\nNauru and nearby Ocean Island were important sources of phosphate for Australian and New Zealand fertilizer production and played an important role on both countries agriculture industries at the time of World War II. The Melbourne-based British Phosphate Commission (BPC) managed the extraction and export of phosphate from the islands and dominated all aspects of Nauruan life. During the year ending 30 June 1940, the BPC shipped almost a million tons of phosphate from Nauru and about half that amount from Ocean Island using its fleet of four vessels (Triadic, Triaster, Triona and Trienza) and chartered merchant ships.\nAs the islands have no harbours or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods — which are common from November to March — the ships had to stop loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships to be allowed to drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.\nDespite their importance to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru and Ocean islands had been allocated a low priority for the limited military assets which were available to protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940. Strategic stockpiles of phosphate had been built up in Australia, however, to lessen the impact of an attack on the islands.\nIn late October 1940, the German raider Orion, which was commanded by Captain Kurt Weyher met Komet, which came under the command of Captain Robert Eyssen, and the supply ship Kulmerland at Lamotrek in the Caroline Islands. Eyssen was the more senior of the two captains, and assumed overall command of the force. The three ships operated off New Zealand's east coast for 18 days during November and sank the small coaster Holmwood and large ocean liner Rangitane with gunfire without being detected by the weak New Zealand defences on 25 and 27 November respectively. Following these attacks, the raiders proceeded to the Kermadec Islands where they transferred their women and children prisoners to Kulmerland on 29 November. The three ships then proceeded to Nauru to attack the island's phosphate industry and the concentration of shipping which the German captains knew was usually present.\n= = Attacks on Nauru = =\nThe German force encountered its first BPC ship while en route to Nauru. On 6 December, Triona (4,413 long tons (4,484 t)) was attacked north-east of the Solomon Islands and was sunk with torpedoes after a chase in which three of her crew were killed by the raiders' guns. All 68 survivors were captured.\nThe raider captains intended to land a shore party and bombard Nauru's shore installations at dawn on 8 December, but bad weather forced them to concentrate on the ships which were off the island. On the evening of 7 December, Komet — which had gone ahead to reconnoitre and was disguised as the Japanese merchant ship Manyo Maru — sank the Norwegian merchant ship Vinni (5,181 long tons (5,264 t)) approximately 9 miles (14 km) south of Nauru. While the raider was spotted from the shore, her disguise was successful and she was assumed to be a merchant ship bound for Japan.\nOrion joined Komet off Nauru in the early hours of 8 December, and attacked and damaged Triadic (6,378 long tons (6,480 t)) and sank Triaster (6,032 long tons (6,129 t)). Komet then tried to sink Triadic with scuttling charges, but this was unsuccessful and Orion sank the merchant ship with gunfire. Komet later sank the British steamer Komata (3,900 long tons (4,000 t)). Following these attacks, the two raiders and Kulmerland withdrew and assembled 20 mi (17 nmi; 32 km) east of Nauru. As the weather precluded a landing on the island, it was decided that Komet and Kulmerland would go to Ailinglaplap in the Marshall Islands where Komet would refuel while Orion operated north-west of Nauru. Following this the ships would meet off the island and make another attempt to land a raiding party.\nWhen the German force reassembled off Nauru on 15 December, the weather continued to be too bad to permit a landing and the attack on Nauru was broken off. Further attacks on shipping were judged impractical as the raiders had intercepted radio messages ordering vessels bound for Nauru and Ocean Island to disperse. Instead, the three German ships proceeded to the Australian-administered island of Emirau to disembark the 675 prisoners they were carrying. While Weyher refused to release any of the European ethnic prisoners on board Orion as he believed that \"trained officers and crews are as much a problem for Britain as shipping itself\", the ships landed 343 Europeans and 171 Chinese and South Pacific-ethnic people.\nFortunately for the Germans, Emirau was one of the few islands in the region to not have a Royal Australian Navy-supplied radio to contact the Australian authorities. The two European families on the island provided the released prisoners with supplies, and sent a canoe to Kavieng in New Ireland to notify the Australian colonial government. A schooner was dispatched to bring additional supplies to Emirau, and arrived there on 24 December. The colonial administrator of New Britain and further supplies was also flown to Emirau on board a flying boat. The released prisoners were embarked onto the steamer Nellore on 29 December to be transported to Townsville in Queensland, where they arrived on 1 January 1941. They provided useful intelligence on the German raiders' operations, and the German Naval Staff issued a directive on 19 February 1941 prohibiting raiders from releasing further prisoners.\nThe three German ships parted company after leaving Emirau on 21 December. Orion proceeded to Lamutrik and then Maug in the Mariana Islands to overhaul her engines, Kulmerland went to Japan and only Komet continued operations in the South Pacific. She attempted to lay mines off Rabaul on 24 December using her motor boat, but this project was abandoned when the boat's engines failed.\nKomet returned to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul, and arrived off the island at 05: 45 on the morning of 27 December. After issuing a warning for those on shore to not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant, she opened fire at 06: 40. The bombardment lasted for about an hour, during which time the raider wrecked the loading plant, oil tanks, boats, buildings and mooring buoys. Following this attack she sailed to the south east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia. This was the last visit of German ships to Nauru during the war, and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean.\n= = Aftermath = =\nThe German raids on Nauru had an impact on the Australian and New Zealand economies and were the greatest success achieved by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. It took ten weeks to resume phosphate shipments from Nauru, and the loss of ships and damaged infrastructure led to a significant decline in output. The resulting phosphate shortages forced the introduction of fertilizer rationing in New Zealand from July 1941. Komet's bombardment of the island also interfered with phosphate consignments to Japan, which caused the Japanese government to threaten to reduce the aid it was providing to Germany. The success of the attacks on Nauru led to rumours in Australia and New Zealand that the raiders had been aided by treachery in the islands. Several investigations were conducted into the rumours and proved them to be unfounded.\nFollowing the raids, the Commonwealth military forces in the Pacific took steps to prevent further attacks by raiders. The Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force flew an increased number of patrols in search of raiders operating near major ports. In addition, the Australian Naval Board requested that the British Admiralty authorise the redeployment of Australian naval units to meet the threat posed by raiders. This was agreed to, and the light cruiser HMAS Sydney and armed merchant cruiser HMAS Kanimbla returned to Australia from other stations. This allowed naval protection to be provided to Nauru and Ocean islands, and the armed merchant cruiser HMAS Manoora arrived off Ocean Island on 4 January 1941 escorting Trienza. Several Australian and New Zealand warships maintained a continual presence off the islands during subsequent months, and two field guns were deployed to each island. The attacks also led to the introduction of convoys between Australia and New Zealand. The naval authorities were able to use the intelligence they gained from the prisoners landed at Emirau to re-route merchant ships away from the areas in which the German raiders were operating; this greatly reduced the effectiveness of the raiders, and Komet and Orion only sank three ships in the period between the attack on Nauru and their return to Europe in late 1941.\n= = Ships sunk = =\nby Komet\n1940-12-06 Triona 4,413 GRT\n1940-12-07 Vinni 5,181 GRT\n1940-12-07 Komata 3,900 GRT\nby Komet together with Orion\n1940-12-08 Triadic 6,378 GRT\n1940-12-08 Triaster 6,032 GRT"

                "text": "= Blair Swannell =\nMajor Blair Inskip Swannell (20 August 1875 – 25 April 1915) was an English-born international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Northampton, and internationally for the British Isles and later Australia. He was invited to tour with the British Isles on their 1899 tour of Australia and then their 1904 tour of Australia and New Zealand. He played a total of seven Test matches on these tours, and scored one Test try – against Australia during the 1904 tour. After settling in Australia, Swannell played a single game for his new home when they faced New Zealand. He was viewed as a violent player, and this made his unpopular with other players. Former Australian captain Herbert Moran said of him that \"... his conception of rugby was one of trained violence\".\nDuring the Second Boer War, Swannell served in the British Army in South Africa, rising to the rank of lieutenant. During the First World War he joined the Australian Imperial Force and was appointed with the rank of major, serving with the 1st Battalion. He was killed on 25 April 1915 while taking part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, during the first day of the Gallipoli Campaign.\n= = Personal history = =\nSwannell was born in Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire on 20 August 1875 to William and Charlotte Swannell, and was the third child of at least five siblings. His father was a farmer, who ran a 423-acre (1.71 km2) farm which employed 17 adults and children. He was home schooled as an infant before beginning his formal education at Repton School. After leaving school he attended the Thames Nautical Training College where he gained qualifications as a second mate. He remained single throughout his life.\nIn 1897 he made his first visit to Australia, as a mate on a schooner. On his return to Britain, Swannell joined the British Army and served in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 35th Battalion (Buckinghamshire) Imperial Yeomanry on 20 January 1902. He retained the rank of honorary lieutenant when he resigned his commission on 3 February 1903. It was reported that during his time in South Africa, he was personally recommended on the field for a commission by General Lord Methuen.\nSwannell was a keen self-promoter, claiming a number of exploits that were so abounding, that his adventures were \"too numerous to be recorded\". These claims included: fighting among the insurrectionists in Uruguay, to have hunted seal down the South American coast and around Cape Horn as well as Labrador, and to have played rugby in France, Germany, South Africa, India and North and South America. Many of these claims are unsubstantiated. One claim that is problematic, was made by the Fielding Star newspaper in 1909, that he took part in the Cape Frontier war. This cannot be a reference to the Xhosa Wars as the last of that series of wars ended in 1879, when he was merely the age of four. An article from 1925, claimed he represented Wales and Argentina.\nAfter touring Australia with the British Isles team for the second time in 1904, he settled in Sydney. A keen all-round sportsman he coached not only rugby but also hockey, was vice-president of the Sydney Swimming Club, and training senior military cadets for surf life-saving examinations. He also joined the Australian Militia, and by 1914 had reached the rank of captain and had passed the promotion exams for the rank of major.\n= = Rugby career = =\nSwannell played as a forward, and in his last Test specifically at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play. He would turn up for training in unwashed kit, and wore the same pair of breeches for every game, again unwashed. His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style, made him an unpopular character in the eyes of other players.\nSwannell first came to note as a rugby player when he represented English club team Northampton. It was while with Northampton that Swannell was invited to tour with Matthew Mullineux's British Isles team, on their 1899 tour of Australia. Swanell played in 17 matches of the tour including three of the four Tests against the Australian national team, missing only the opening defeat. Swannell scored in only one game on the tour, a try in a win over the New South Wales Waratahs on 29 July 1899.\nSwannell returned to Britain with the touring team, and was reselected for the 1904 tour, this time taking in Australia and New Zealand. Swannell played in 15 games, including all four Test Matches, three against Australia and the final Test against New Zealand. In the third Test, Swannell scored his first and only international points, a try against Australia in Sydney. The British Isles were victorious over the Australians, but lost the New Zealand match, this was the first international game that Swannell had been on the losing side. In the New Zealand clash, Swannell's violent playing style, was targeted by countering with equally rough play. He left the field at the end of the match with two black eyes, and bleeding, but with his spirit undaunted.\nWhen the touring British team returned home after the 1904 campaign, Swannell along with team-mates David Bedell-Sivright, and Dr. Sidney Crowther decided to remain in Australia, to begin new lives, although Crowther later returned to England. Swannell joined club team Northern Suburbs, based in Sydney. In 1905 he was selected to play for the Australian national team, even though he had already faced them as an opponent on six occasions. The match was against New Zealand, and was the first overseas tour the Australians had undertaken; Australia lost 14 – 3. Wallaby captain Herbert Moran didn't mince words when speaking of Swannell in Viewless Winds saying \"Swannell was, for a number of years, a bad influence in Sydney football... his conception of rugby was one of trained violence\"\nWith his playing career behind him, Swannell continued his involvement with the sport by coaching at youth and school level, namely at St Joseph's College where he coached the team to a number of championships. He was an advocate for team training and in particular for forwards to rehearse scrummaging and break-down techniques. He argued that the forwards won or lost the game. In 1909, he became Secretary of the Metropolitan Rugby Union, and in 1910 the club raised his salary from £200 to £250. Financial stress on the club lead him to resign in 1911 to save expense, but he continued in an 'honorary position'. He also served as a referee from 1911 to 1914, earning praise for his ability to control the game.\nWhile in Australia, Swannell was often approached by the sporting press for his opinion on rugby matters. Particularly on clashes between British and Antipodean teams, including the 1905 New Zealand tour. He was vocal in his support for maintaining the amateur nature of rugby, but did not side with Bedell-Sivright in denying that a stipend had been paid during the 1904 tour. In 1908 he was also hired to write a series of articles for the Star on the topic of forward play, and scrummaging.\n= = Gallipoli and death = =\nWith the outbreak of the First World War, Swannell enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, was appointed to the rank of major and posted to Egypt, travelling on the SS Afric. In April 1915, Swannell was part of the Australian forces sent to partake in the Gallipoli Campaign; an attempt to capture the Ottoman city of Istanbul. Swannell and his men from D Company of the 1st Battalion, transported on the troopship SS Minewasska, landed at the peninsula on 25 April, and were immediately involved in heavy fighting after being diverted to reinforce the 12th Battalion. In the buildup to the assault on the hill known as Baby 700, Swannell and his men were pinned down under heavy enemy fire, and while attempting to show his men the best method of aiming their rifles, he was shot in the head and killed. He is commemorated at Baby 700 Cemetery in Gallipoli, and also with a plaque on the walls at Weston-Underwood church in Buckinghamshire.\nIn April 2015 for the centenary of the Gallipoli landings, fellow Northampton Saints and England rugby international Ben Foden, was featured narrating tributes to Swannell on both BBC TV regional news and Radio Northampton. Foden penned and read the following message at the grave of Blair Swannell in Turkey:\nFrom the turf of Franklin's Gardens where you stood,\nTo the shores of Gallipoli where you fell,\nA truer Saintsman I know not,\nForever bleeding green, black and gold.\nRest in peace"

It was released by Syco Music on 3 December 2012, as the record's second single. The song was written by Fiona Bevan and Ed Sheeran, and produced by Jake Gosling. Bevan brought the song to Sheeran's attention while he was in studio with the group in 2012, resulting in the band recording it. \"Little Things\" is a mid-tempo pop and folk ballad about the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique.\nThe track received mixed to negative reviews from contemporary music critics, many of whom felt that the song is not tailored to them. The song became the group's second number-one hit in the United Kingdom, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand. In addition, it attained top forty positions in Belgium (Wallonia), Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. The single has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.\nDirected by Vaughan Arnell, the accompanying music video was shot in black-and-white and consists of a simplistic concept — One Direction recording the song. Upon release, it received positive reviews from reviewers, who noted that it was a perfect accompaniment for the song. The band performed the track on both the UK and US versions of The X Factor and during their 3 major conert tours: Take Me Home Tour (2013), Where We Are Tour (2014) and On the Road Again Tour (2015).\n= = Background and conception = =\n\"Little Things\" was written by British singer-songwriters Ed Sheeran and Fiona Bevan, and produced by Jake Gosling. In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Sheeran for their second studio album. In June 2012, Sheeran disclosed that One Direction would be recording two of his songs. In October 2012, Sheeran acknowledged Bevan's songwriting credit in an interview with British radio network Capital FM: \"The great thing about it is I wrote that song with a girl called Fiona Bevan when I was 17 and we lost the song. I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago she sent me the tune and was like, 'Oh, do you remember this?' I was like, 'Yeah, I do remember that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at the time and I was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'. It's got one of my favourite lines that I've ever written in a song.\" On 15 October 2012, Louis Tomlinson confirmed via social networking website Twitter that \"Little Things\" would serve as the second single of their second studio album Take Me Home.\n= = Composition and lyrics = =\n\"Little Things\" is a mid-tempo pop and folk ballad which runs for 3: 39 (3 minutes, 39 seconds). Written in the key of G major, the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 110 beats per minute. One Direction's vocal range in the song span from the note of A3 to D5. Instrumentation includes guitar strings, piano lines and vocals. The song utilises an acoustic guitar riff and a rotation of lead vocals. The song's lyrics revolve around the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique. In a September 2012 interview with MTV News, Sheeran quipped that the song \"is about the best things about someone, kind of like the things you wouldn't expect.\" He described \"Little Things\" as an \"appreciation song,\" and concluded: \"Seventeen-year-old Ed just wrote a lot of love songs\".\n= = Critical reception = =\n\"Little Things\" received mixed to negative reviews from music critics. Grady Smith for Entertainment Weekly described its lyricism as \"terribly misguided\" for One Direction's target audience. Melinda Newman of HitFix, polarised by its lyrical content, wrote that women want men to pretend their flaws do not exist and not see them. Both Kate Wills of The Independent and Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan criticised the lyrical content as jarring. Although Bill Lamb of About.com shared Smith's sentiment, he favoured Gosling's \"beautiful\" production of the song and the group's \"top notch\" vocal performance. Al Fox of BBC Music, who noted a \"pursuit for credibility\", felt that One Direction were \"handing in their identity\" with \"Little Things\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times dismissed Sheeran's songwriting as \"unusually lumpy in the hands of such a polished group\". In contrast, Alexis Petridis for The Guardian described the track as \"noticeably more sophisticated lyrically and emotionally than anything else on the album.\" The Boston Globe editor Sarah Rodman selected the \"essential\" song as the album's \"best\" attribute, and Matt Collar from AllMusic considered the ballad \"an air of maturity to One Direction's admittedly squeaky-fresh sound.\" Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt that \"Little Things\" can be interpreted as \"minor signs of growth\" for the boy band.\n= = Commercial performance = =\n\"Little Things\" made its Irish Singles Chart debut at number two in the week ending 15 November 2012, marking One Direction's fifth top-ten hit in Ireland. The track debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 18 November 2012, becoming One Direction's second number-one hit in the United Kingdom. Their second studio album Take Me Home and the single both debuted simultaneously at number one in the UK, making One Direction the youngest act in British chart history to achieve the feat. In addition, the song became a top forty hit in Belgium (Wallonia), Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland. It became their third song to attain a top-forty position in both Sweden and Belgium (Wallonia). Elsewhere in Europe, the song charted in lower regions on the singles charts of Austria, Belgium (Flanders), France, Germany, and Slovakia.\nThe single bowed at number nine on the Australian Singles Chart of 25 November 2012, marking its peak position and the group's fourth top ten hit in Australia. It held that position for a second week and has been certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of 210,000 copies. The track made its New Zealand Singles Chart debut at number two on 19 November 2012, denoting its highest charting position and the quintet's third top five appearance in New Zealand. \"Little Things\" has received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), indicating sales of 7,500 copies.\nThe ballad became One Direction's fourth top forty hit on the Canadian Hot 100, peaking at number 20. In the week ending 18 November 2012, \"Little Things\" debuted on the United States Billboard Hot 100 at number 41, selling 91,000 copies in its first week. As a result of an \"end-of-year download rush\" in the week ending 30 December 2012, the single's weekly sales rose 189% from the previous week to 153,000 copies sold. The sales rise signified a new peak of number 33 on the Hot 100 by the single's seventh charting week. The track marks the boy band's fourth top forty hit on the Hot 100 and also attained positions on the Pop Songs and Hot 100 Airplay charts, peaking at numbers 19 and 61, respectively. \"Little Things\" had sold 502,000 copies in the United States by 7 January 2013. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 9 May 2013, denoting shipments of 1,000,000 copies.\n= = Music video = =\nThe music video for \"Little Things\" was shot entirely in black-and-white and directed by Vaughan Arnell, who had previously directed the band's music video for their previous single \"Live While We're Young\". Tomlinson disclosed via social networking website Twitter that an accompanying music video for \"Little Things\" was in production on 15 October 2012. Band member Zayn Malik confirmed that they had finished filming the video the following day. On each of the five days preceding the video's premiere, One Direction posted a teaser trailer of the video online. Each teaser showed footage from the video and behind the scenes, and one member of the band announcing how many days were left until the video premiere. The official video was uploaded to their Vevo account on YouTube on 2 November 2012.\nThe music video consists of a simplistic concept — a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell said he did not want to make it about anything more than that, \"When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track.\" Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was \"the most pure way to do it\". He wanted to make the music video as \"uncontrived as possible\" without \"any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it.\" While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was \"one of the hardest things I've ever done.\" The group performed it \"over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities.\" As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, \"It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [and] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you.\"\nUpon release, '# LittleThingsOnVEVO' became the number-one trending topic worldwide on social networking website Twitter. Following the release of the music video for \"Little Things\" and its accompanying teaser videos, One Direction posted a 138% increase in Vevo plays and a 159% increase in Facebook reaction in the United States. As a result of the video schedule, the group topped Billboard's Social 50 chart for the first time in their 52nd week on the chart, rising 10-1 from the previous week. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News characterised it as a straightforward video, which has a \"quiet tone\" that \"complements the ballad's sentimental lyrics.\" Sam Lanksy for Idolator called it \"sweet and subdued\" and noted that the video is a significant transition from the \"over-the-top jubilance\" of their \"Live While We're Young\" video, writing that the contrast \"is nice — even if the ultimate effect is a little sleepy.\" A reviewer of The Huffington Post favoured \"the low-key, laid-back\" approach to the video and concluded that the \"intimate feel of the video perfectly accompanies the songs' sweet lyrics\". An editor for Capital FM highlighted sequences in which the boy band \"share individual emotionally charged scenes.\"\n= = Live performances = =\nOne Direction performed \"Little Things\" and \"Live While We're Young\" on The X Factor USA (8 November), and \"Little Things\" on The X Factor UK (11 November). The band performed the song along with \"What Makes You Beautiful\", \"Live While We're Young\", and \"Kiss You\" on The Today Show at the Rockefeller Center (13 November), to a record crowd estimated at 15,000. They performed \"Live While We're Young\" and \"Little Things\" on the BBC's Children in Need 2012 telethon (16 November). In addition, they performed \"Little Things\" on British television series Surprise, Surprise (18 November - Recorded 21 October), at the 2012 Royal Variety Performance (19 November), in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, and on The X Factor Australia (20 November). \"Little Things\" was included on the set list of the group's headlining sold-out show at Madison Square Garden (3 December).

                "text": "= OMG (song) =\nFor other songs titled OMG, see OMG\n\"OMG\" is a song by American recording artist Usher and American rapper will.i.am, who also wrote and produced the song. It uses the auto-tune effect in several lines, as well as Jock Jams-esque sports arena chanting. It was released on March 22, 2010 as the first worldwide single off his sixth studio album, Raymond v. Raymond, and the fourth single overall, following the three US singles \"Papers\", \"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\", and \"Lil Freak\". The song was met with a mixed reception from critics, who criticized the use of auto-tune, but commended the song's dance and club vibe. The song marks the second time that Usher has collaborated with will.i.am, following the single \"What's Your Name\", from his previous album Here I Stand (2008).\n\"OMG\" topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. The song became his ninth number-one hit in the United States, making him the first 2010s artist to collect number-one singles in three consecutive decades. He became only the fourth artist of all-time to achieve that feat. Usher also became the third artist to have at least one number-one song from five consecutive studio albums. The song's choreography and dance-heavy accompanying music video has been compared by critics to that of \"Yeah!\". Usher performed the song live several times including on the ninth season of American Idol with will.i.am. He also performed the song as a part of a medley during his critically acclaimed performance at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. \"OMG\", was named the fifth best selling song of 2010 in the US, selling 3.8 million units. The song sold 6.9 million copies worldwide during that year.\n= = Production and composition = =\n\"OMG was written and produced by The Black Eyed Peas frontman, will.i.am. The tune was recorded at Chung King Studios, New York City. Dylan\" 3-D \"Dresdow mixed the record at Paper V.U. Studios, North Hollywood. The vocal sample of a crowd shouting\" owowowo \"used in the song was recorded by will.i.am while performing with The Black Eyed Peas on the French TV show Taratata.\n\"OMG\" is a midtempo pop song, drawing from the subgenres of dance-pop and synthpop, and is also influenced by R & B. The song also infuses hints of Eurodance. Several lines feature the Auto-Tune vocal effect, and makes use of \"hypnotic\" hand claps, and Jock Jams-esque arena chanting. The song is set in common time, and has a tempo of 130 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E minor, and Usher's vocals span from the low note of G3 to high note of E5. It follows the chord progression Em – D – Bm7 – C6. According to James Reed of the Boston Globe, Usher is featured in a staccato delivery over the song's minimalist dance beat. \"will.i.am begins the song with the line,\" Oh my gosh \"then Usher starts singing the chorus. He performs his verse and the second chorus, before will.i.am gives his verse.\" OMG \"concludes with an extended final chorus. Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times said that the lyrics of the song detail Usher's encounter with a woman in a club.\n= = Reception = =\n= = = Critical = = =\nThe song has garnered mixed reception, with most critics disapproving of the auto-tuned vocals, and the production and appearance by will.i.am. Edna Gundersen of USA Today said that Usher seemed \"disengaged\" on the song, and allowed will.i.am. to \"bludgeon\" the song with auto-tune. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said the song was one of the tracks where production fell short on Raymond v. Raymond, calling the song another auto-tuned \"formulaic chant\" by will.i.am. The New York Daily News said that the song is \"as annoying as the tech-speak it mimics.\" Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine preferred \"Lil Freak\" to be the album's big single, stating that the song \"doesn't come close to matching the filthy heights of\" Little Freak, \"[sic] but the sports arena chanting thing hasn't been done this well since the '90s when Jock Jams were enormous.\" Winistorfer also said that Usher brought back his \"bad taste\" in collaborators since Lil Jon on \"Yeah!\", saying that having the latter on this song would be an improvement.\nJames Reed of the Boston Globe said that Usher \"fares better\" on the collaboration. Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times commended the song's \"thumping\" groove. Gail Mitchell of Billboard said that Usher \"pumps up the beat on the infectious club anthem.\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, called the track \"irresistible\". Monica Herrera of Billboard magazine said the song, like \"Yeah!\", appealed to a broader audience and attuned to clubs. Herrera also said that \"the lyrics are hypnotic hand claps and soccer-game chants that fade in and out to keep the party going\".\n= = = Controversy = = =\nIn 2010, WYOY disc jockeys compared part of Usher's verse to a song sung by Homer Simpson in \"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\", a 2003 episode of television comedy The Simpsons. The cadences of the line, \"Honey got a booty like pow, pow, pow. Honey got some boobies like wow, oh wow\" were compared to those of Simpson's tune, \"Christmas in December, wow wow wow. Give me tons of presents, now now now.\" Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly disagreed, calling the likenesses \"a random coincidence\".\n= = Chart performance = =\nThe song debuted at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100 selling 130,000 units in its first week. The song became the third-highest debut on the Billboard Hot 100 of Usher's career, behind 1997's \"Nice & Slow\" at number nine, and 1998's \"My Way\" at eight. For the week ending May 15, 2010, the song lifted to number one on the chart, becoming Usher's ninth number-one single and Will.i.am's first number one single as a solo artist (or without his group, The Black eyed Peas). The song collected airplay and digital gainer honors, moving fourteen to seven on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, and two to one on the Hot Digital Songs chart. The song later topped both charts. By March 2011, the song has reached 4 million in sales, and as of May 2013, the song has sold 4,719,000 copies.\nWith the song, Usher tied with the Bee Gees, Elton John, and Paul McCartney for ninth among artists all time with the most Hot 100 hits. Usher also became the third artist, behind McCartney and Michael Jackson to collect at least one number-one single from five consecutive albums. The song made Usher the first artist in the 2010s to have a number-one single in three consecutive decades, Usher's being the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. He became only the fifth artist of all time to accomplish this, the others being Stevie Wonder in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; Michael Jackson in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; and Madonna and Janet Jackson in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. \"OMG\" was the second shortest title to lead the chart, tying Jackson's \"Ben\", \"Bad\", and \"ABC\" with the Jackson 5, with Britney Spears' \"3\" being the chart-topper with the shortest title.\nThe song charted at number three on the R & B / Hip-Hop Songs chart, two on the Pop Songs chart, and three on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. It also topped the Rhythmic Top 40, making Usher the first artist to collect ten number ones on the chart, above 50 Cent, Beyoncé, Nelly, T-Pain, and Mariah Carey, each with seven. Usher led first on the chart with \"You Make Me Wanna\" for thirteen weeks from 1997 – 1998 and \"Love in This Club\" featuring Young Jeezy in 2008.\n\"OMG\" reached number two in Canada, and was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. It was later upgraded to 2x Platinum for shipments over 160,000 copies. It sold 223,000 copies during 2010 in Canada. Internationally, \"OMG\" charted across Europe, reaching number one in the Ireland, and United Kingdom where it became the third best selling song of 2010. It also charted moderately in other countries, allowing it to reach a peak of six on the European Hot 100. In Australia and New Zealand the song placed at the top of the charts. It was certified 2 × Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association, and Platinum in New Zealand by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand for shipments of 15,000 units. It was later upgraded to 5 × Platinum in Australia for shipments over 350,000 copies.\n= = Music video = =\n= = = Background = = =\nUsher and will.i.am shot the video the weekend of March 6, 2010. The video was directed by Anthony Mandler. In an interview with Rap-Up, Mandler said about the concept of the video: \"... The video is a spectacle. It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is, and most importantly, it ’ s really a video that showcases his superstardom\". The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television at the beginning of the video. Mandler specified, commenting, \"Max Headroom was always in his room,\" he continued, \"this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration.\" Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, \"working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible.\" Mandler described the visuals in the clip as \"Hitchcock-ian\", as well as simply captuiring Usher in his element, as he said he wanted the R & B singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating,\n\"The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, in that, I wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, and you never know what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're so focused on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next.\"\n= = = Synopsis and reception = = =\nThe video begins with Usher flickering on a television in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside in front of a concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.\nIn a review of the video, Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly said, \"For a song with such a title, it sure does take a minute for its video to build up to wow-worthy moments. After some clean dance sequences, the magic begins. Usher grooves with shadows, puffs out O ’ s with cigar smoke, and then links back up with his ladies on a primary colored dance floor to show off his steps.\" Chris Ryan of MTV News compared the video's flashing lights to the music video for \"Yeah!\", and called the song an answer track to Trey Songz's \"LOL\". At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, the clip was nominated for Best Dance Video, Best Choreography, and Best Male Video.\n= = Live performances = =\nUsher performed the song with will.i.am. on the ninth season of American Idol, appearing in a black bowler and matching black suit with silver lapels, accompanied by flames and other pyrotechnics. They then performed the song together on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 10, 2010. The song has also been performed live in Australia on Hey Hey it's Saturday on May 19, 2010, as well as on Sunrise on May 21, 2010. Usher later performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, So You Think You Can Dance, Good Morning America and live in the United Kingdom on Britain's Got Talent. On August 6, 2010, he performed the song alongside other hits at his New Look Foundation ’ s inaugural World Leadership Awards in Atlanta, where his protege Justin Bieber and R & B singer Ciara also performed. Another event the song was performed at was the Activision E3 Event. The song was performed alongside \"DJ Got Us Fallin 'in Love\" during the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. VMA executive producer Dave Sirulnick told MTV News, \"We said to him,' We want to do the best televised dance routine that you've done in years. Let's show why you're the king. '\" MTV Buzzworthy writer, Tamar Antai was present at the rehearsal for the show, and commented that the VMA crew was about to \"pull off visual feats not just previously unseen and unparalleled at the VMAs, but unseen and unparalleled on TV.\"\nThe performance was received with critical acclaim. On Usher specifically Antai said the performance was like \"liquid magic\", saying, \"He took it to the level that comes after the next level. The penthouse level.\" He was aided by about a dozen background dancers, the males in skeleton-like costumets, and the females donning a one-piece, gloves and boots. The \"OMG\" performance was accompanied by red laser lights, making an illusion as if the stage disappeared. The lights spelled out \"O.M.G\" as well as \"Usher\", as dancers lowered from the ceiling. Jayson Rodrgiguez of MTV News commented, \"The singer moved and grooved, proving that he's the R & B star that everyone pays attention to for the big moments.\" Rochell D. Thomas, also of the site said \"Call it what you will: talent, swag, skills... When he steps on the dance floor, some mysterious thing comes out of him and puts the G in groove.\" Thomas went on to say that Usher's dance moves would make \"the late great Michael Jackson jealous\" in the stage production \"that included more special-effects bells and whistles than a summer blockbuster.\" Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy also compared the performance to Jackson, calling it overall, \"One part\" Tron, \"one part laser show, one part Michael Jackson choreo tribute, and all spectacle.\" Usher appeared with The Black Eyed Peas to perform the song during the halftime show of Super Bowl XLV.\n= = Track listing = =\n= = Personnel = =\nVocals - Usher\nLyrics, music, production, instruments, recording, engineering, vocals – will.i.am\nMixing – Dylan \"3-D\" Dresdow\nSource:\n= = Charts = =\n= = Certifications = =\n= = Release history = ="

It was written by Samuel Barnes, Scott La Rock, Makeba Riddick, Jean-Claude Oliver, Lawrence Parker, and produced by Poke & Tone. It was released on September 13, 2005, as the second and final single from the album. The lyrics revolve around \"basically telling a guy,' If it's lovin 'that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".\nThe song received mixed reviews from music critics, many of whom praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance; its composition was also complimented. \"If It's Lovin 'that You Want\" achieved moderate success around the world, reaching the top forty in few European countries, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States, the song failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"Pon de Replay\", peaking at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It managed, however, to reach number nine on the Pop Songs chart. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Marcus Raboy, was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer enjoying various activities, such as dancing and riding jet skis with her friends.\n= = Background and composition = =\nFollowing the release and commercial success of \"Pon de Replay\", the lead single from Music of the Sun and Rihanna's debut in the music industry, \"If It's Lovin 'that You Want\" was released as the second single from the album. In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna explained the lyrical meaning behind the song, saying \"The song is basically telling a guy,' If it's lovin 'that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\". A sequel to the song entitled \"If It's Lovin' That You Want – Part 2\", which features rap vocals by Cory Gunz, was included as a bonus track on Rihanna's sophomore album, A Girl Like Me (2006). The song was written by Samuel Barnes, Scott LaRock, Makeba Riddick, Jean-Claude Oliver, Lawrence Parker and was produced by the latter two under their production name, Poke & Tone of Trackmasters. According to the digital music sheet published at musicnotes.com, \"If It's Lovin 'that You Want\" is written in the key of A-flat major and is set in common time with a moderate dance goove with a metronome of 98 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of G5.\n= = Critical reception = =\nThe song was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics, who both praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that although the singer provides \"simple, pleasant vocals\", her voice sounds \"too light\" and \"thin\". Lamb continued to comment about the song, writing that although the song is \"pleasurable\" and \"summery\" to listen to and is not \"offensive\", it fails to re-capture the \"killer hook of 'Pon de Replay'\". However, A. Vishnu of The Hindu had contrasting opinions with regard to Rihanna's vocal performance, writing the song further \"exposes her versatility and vocal range\". A reviewer for Billboard praised the song's composition and beat, writing \"['If It's Lovin' that You Want '] reinforces Rihanna's tropical reggae signature with an itchy hook that, albeit monotonous, cannot miss.\" A reviewer of Take40 and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times were brief in their reviews of \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", with the former writing that the song is more \"low-key\" compared to Rihanna's previous release, \"Pon de Replay\", and the latter simply writing that it is a \"pretty good\" song.\n= = Chart performance = =\n\"If It's Lovin 'that You Want\" failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"Pon de Replay\", only peaking within the top ten of three national charts. In the United States, the song debuted at ninety six on October 22, 2005 and managed to peak at number 36 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on December 31, 2005, and number 99 on the US Hot R & B / Hip-Hop Songs chart on October 29, 2005. In Australia, the song debuted and peaked on the Australian Singles Chart at number 9 on February 6, 2006. The song fell one position the following week to number ten, but managed to peak at number 9 again in its third week. In total, the song spent two non-consecutive weeks at number 9 and fourteen weeks on the chart. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number 12 on the New Zealand Singles Chart on December 19, 2005. During \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" 's first four weeks of charting, it fluctuated in the top twenty, but managed to peak at number 9 in its fifth week for one week. In total, the song spent 12 weeks on the chart.\nIn Europe, \"If It's Lovin 'that You Want\" debuted on the Austrian Singles Chart at number 40 on December 16, 2005. During the song's first five weeks on the chart, it struggled to stay inside the top forty, but in its sixth week, managed to peak at number 31 for one week, and spent a total of 11 weeks on the chart. In Switzerland, the song debuted at number 25 on December 18, 2005, and peaked at number 19. The song spent a total of 12 weeks on the chart. In The Netherlands, the song debuted at number 76 on February 4, 2006, and peaked at number 13 the following week. The song spent a total of 7 weeks on the chart. In the Flanders region of Belgium, the song debuted at number 50 December 31, 2005, but dropped out of the chart the following week, but re-entered the chart at number 38 on January 21, 2006, and peaked at number 25 the following week. The song spent a total of 10 weeks on the chart. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted and peaked on the UK Singles Chart at number 11 on December 10, 2005, and dropped out of the Official UK Top 40 after five weeks on the chart.\n= = Music video = =\nThe music video for the song was shot on a stretch of beach on the coast of California in Malibu and directed by Marcus Raboy. In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna spoke about the development of the shoot for the video, saying \"The water was so cold... but oh my gosh, we had so much fun... We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball\". During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying \"This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean... we did some mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand... and I'm just [performing] to the camera as if it were my boyfriend. Now we're going to do [some scenes with] the Tiki torches. It's going to be incredible\". The dance routines in the video were choreographed by noted choreographer Fatima Robinson.\nThe video begins with scenes of Rihanna dancing and walking along the beach and riding jet ski's with her friends during the first chorus and continues into the first verse. Halfway through the first verse, a new scene of the singer is introduced, where she is dancing on a platform with four other female dancers, wearing a \"short, flowing white skirt and a cropped tee\", with the ocean as the backdrop behind her. During the second chorus, the previous scenes are intercut with each other, and continue into the second verse, where a new scene of the singer wearing a different outfit and lying on the beach, whilst also interacting with some male extras. For the third chorus, which is repeated twice, another new scene of Rihanna is shown with four other female dancers who belly dance in the middle of a Tiki torch circle during the night. The chorus is repeated for a final time, where scenes from throughout the video are intercut with each other.\n= = Track listing = =\n= = Charts = =\n= = Certifications = =\n= = Release history = ="

                "text": "= Albert Downing =\nAlbert \"Doolan\" Joseph Downing (12 July 1886 – 8 August 1915) was a New Zealand international rugby union player, capped 26 times at lock between 1913 and 1914. He was born in Napier, and began his playing career for Napier Marist in 1909, from which he was selected for Hawke's Bay and for the North Island. He moved at the end of 1912 to Auckland and there joined Auckland Marist, where he was the club's first All Black, playing his debut match against a touring Australian team in 1913. He was selected for the highly successful tour of North America in 1913, playing in 14 of the 16 matches and scoring 6 tries.\nWhile the All Blacks were on a tour of Australia in 1914, the British Empire declared war on Germany and the team collectively decided to enlist. Three of them were killed, Downing the first of the All Blacks in World War I. After enlisting in early 1915, he took part in the Battle of Chunuk Bair, part of the Gallipoli Campaign, and was killed on 8 August. Henry Dewar, a team mate from the USA tour, died the following day at Anzac Cove.\n= = Early life = =\nAlbert Downing was born on 12 July 1886 in Port Ahuriri, Napier, New Zealand, the eldest son of Mr and Mrs John Downing. He attended Napier Boys' High School until 1904. He was a farmer before joining Barry Brothers, carriers and coal merchants, choosing to work as a carter outdoors, rather than join the clerical staff. Later, he worked as a storeman for the Ellison and Duncan Company.\n= = Rugby career = =\nDowning ’ s rugby career, playing at lock, started with the Napier Old Boys Rugby Club and then Napier Marist Rugby Club; he represented Hawke's Bay from 1909 to 1912. In 1911, he was selected for a North Island Country team, playing all games of a five match tour. The tour was part of a scheme by the New Zealand Rugby Union to discover talent, which brought Downing to the selectors' attention. The North Island team played four games, against Auckland, Taranaki Union, Wanganui and Wellington, between 29 July and 9 August, and played a final match against the South Island on 12 August. Reports from the tour show Downing was very involved in the games, scoring a try against Wanganui for a 13 – 0 victory, and nearly scoring in a close game against Auckland, which resulted in a 8 – 8 draw. The North versus South match, which the North won 18 – 6, was described in the press as lacking in quality: it was an \"uninteresting match\", and \"play was crude and poor and lacked vigour\". Downing stood out: \"The only member of either team who could be said to have played up to inter-island form was Downing – a fine forward in the North Island team.\"\nThe following year, Downing's name was put forward by Hawke's Bay to play for the North Island in the annual Inter-Island match and he made selection. The North beat the South 12 – 8 in a closely contested, entertaining game in front of a full capacity crowd. The Northern forwards in general played a good game; it was suggested that Downing's passing back from the lineout to the halfback was something that other forwards might consider imitating. A tour with the North Island Country team followed, in which Downing played all four games. The last, against South Island Country in Wellington on 4 August, had to be stopped at half time due to the condition of the match ground, and the North won 14 – 3. His Hawke's Bay and North Island Country team-mate Norman McKenzie described him as \"an outstanding line-out forward with a wonderful pair of hands\".\n= = = Auckland and the All Blacks = = =\nDowning relocated to Auckland at the end of 1912 and was recruited by Auckland Marists on the strength of his playing and the links with the Napier Marists. He was the club's first All Black, joined shortly after by Jim \"Buster\" Barrett. Downing's debut match was against Australia in Wellington on 6 September, which the All Blacks won easily 30 – 6, bettering Australia \"in every respect\".\nHe was subsequently selected for the tour of North America the same year. On 10 September, the eve of departure, Wellington took on the All Blacks in a \"thrilling\" game which saw the visitors nearly defeated. With the wind behind them in the first half, the All Blacks gained a 13-point lead; but in the second half, Wellington came back strongly; and with a drop-goal in the final three minutes, closed the lead to just one point, 19 – 18. There was strong back play on both sides; amongst the forwards, one player from each side received special mention in the press: Downing for the All Blacks, Miller for Wellington.\nIt is possible that Downing might not have been selected for the tour had he not moved to Auckland. As it was, he played in 14 of the 16 matches, and contributed 6 tries for 18 points towards a total tally of 610 points. There was little interest in the American press about the tour. A single short paragraph in the New York Tribune reports on the 51 – 3 defeat of the All America team on 15 November. In New Zealand, meanwhile, detailed match reports were coming in, and many of these were full of praise for Downing. Of all the players in the USA match, four would die in the Great War: Frank Jacob Gard, the USA captain (died 29 September 1918); and three All Blacks: Henry Dewar, George Sellars and Downing himself.\nIn 1914, Downing was again selected for the Inter-Island match in Wellington on 9 June, which the South won 8 – 0. Later in the year, four of Downing's Marist team-mates were with him in the All Black side selected to tour Australia: Barrett, five eighths Jock McKenzie, who had transferred from Wellington, and fullback Jack O ’ Brien, a founding member of the club. The All Blacks played Wellington again on the day before leaving for Australia, this time losing 19 – 14, Downing contributing a try. Downing played in 10 of the 11 matches, including the 3 tests, and was praised for his line-out ability. In the first test on 18 July, he was, according to The Star, \"easily the best forward in the team\", and after the second test, The Southland Times opined that \"it is quite possible that before he leaves the lengthy Aucklander may prove himself to be included in the star category of New Zealand forwards.\"\nIn an obituary, Downing was described as \"big, strong, fast, brainy, clever with hands and feet, dashing, and resourceful.\" He was best known for his work in the line-out and in the loose, equally good in attack as in defence. He played hard but clean. Such was his devotion to rugby that Downing had a tattoo on his left forearm of the Ranfurly Shield.\n= = = International appearances = = =\n= = Military career = =\nDuring the All Black tour of Australia, in the game against Metropolitan Union in Sydney on 5 August 1914, the news was posted on the scoreboard that the British Empire – and therefore New Zealand and Australia – had declared war. On the ship home, the players collectively decided to volunteer for military service. Three of them were killed, including Downing at Gallipoli, Bobby Black at the Somme and Jim McNeece at Messines.\nDowning enlisted with the Fifth Reinforcements (Wellington Battalion) on 2 February 1915. While doing basic training, he also played two games of rugby for the Trentham Military Forces Team, against Wellington on 1 May and Auckland on 5 June. In the first of these, Downing was reckoned to be the standout forward of the Trentham team, and \"played splendidly\".\nOn 13 June, he departed bound for Suez in Egypt, arriving 24 July. His unit took part, beginning on 6 August, in the Battle of Chunuk Bair, in support of the landing at Suvla Bay, which was intended to break the deadlock in the Gallipoli Campaign. The initial assault was successful and early on the morning of 8 August, Downing was with A Company occupying the Turkish trench on the crest of Chunuck Bair. The Turks counter-attacked at dawn, forcing back the British battalions and the Wellingtons. The crest was lost and the battle continued for 12 hours on the seaward slopes. By nightfall, Downing, who had earlier distinguished himself in a bayonet charge, was killed, reportedly \"blown to pieces\". Downing was the first of 13 All Blacks killed in the war, just a day before Henry Dewar, the second All Black to fall, was killed in action with the Wellington Mounted Rifles at Anzac Cove.\nSergeant Doolan Downing is commemorated on panel 17 of the New Zealand Memorial to the Missing on Chunuk Bair, along with his commanding-officer, Lt Col William George Malone, who died aged 56, and more than 300 other men of his battalion."

Initially hosted at the domain name scientomogy.info, the site was created in 2005 in response to the extensive media publicity surrounding Cruise's appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Today Show.\nScienTOMogy gained press attention after the site proprietor was contacted by the Church of Scientology with a cease and desist letter, alleging copyright infringement by claiming the word \"Scientomogy\" was too close to the word \"Scientology.\" The proprietor initially agreed to relent to the Church's demands, but then decided to keep the site after consulting with attorneys. Internet traffic to the site later increased dramatically as a result of the media attention surrounding the Church of Scientology's allegations of copyright infringement.\n= = Development = =\nNew Zealand webmaster Glen Stollery created scientomogy.info in July 2005, after Tom Cruise appeared on The Today Show in an interview speaking about \"the dangers of prescription drugs,\" and following the incident where he jumped the couch over his love for Katie Holmes during an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The site's stated goal was \"exposing Tom Cruise's moronic behavior in his relentless crusade to promote the Church of Scientology.\"\nThe site was mainly used to store parody and satire material, including depictions of Cruise and Holmes in straight jackets, as well as a video showing Cruise shooting lightning at Oprah Winfrey. To clarify its position as a parody site, ScienTOMogy contained a disclaimer, which it requested that the reader \"understand and agree to.. before continuing.\" The site's disclaimer stated: \"Obviously www.scienTOMogy.info has ABSOLUTELY NO connection whatsoever with the Church of Scientology, it ’ s [sic] affiliated organizations or, needless-to-say, Tom Cruise. It is designed for commentary and criticism within the limits of Free Speech. All content should be treated as opinion and all trademarks / copyrighted material herein are owned by their respective trademark owners. The Scientology site is here. Thank you. You may continue..\" On the site, a fake Cruise claims that the Church of Scientology should refer to itself as \"ScienTOMogy\" instead of Scientology, in order to clear up public relations problems. The parody version of Cruise states \"It's kind of like the word gummy bears. Bears by themselves are scary, but if you just add the word gummy to it, it now becomes a fun, enjoyable treat.\"\n= = Church of Scientology's response = =\nThe Web site drew media attention when the Church of Scientology's attorneys Moxon & Kobrin contacted Stollery, claiming the ScienTOMogy domain name was an infringement of their trademark, despite being a different word by one letter. In September 2005, the Church of Scientology issued a cease and desist order to Stollery demanding he shut down the site and transfer ownership to the Church, threatening him with a $100,000 lawsuit. The Church's law firm stated that \"ScienTOMogy\" would cause a likelihood of confusion with \"Scientology,\" violating the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1125 (a). The Church of Scientology's letter stated: \"You are hereby on notice that the registration and use of this domain name in this fashion has caused your name to be falsely associated with our client ’ s registered mark, SCIENTOLOGY.. The fact that you have changed one letter.. does not protect you from trademark infringement.\" Helena Kobrin, a lawyer for the Church of Scientology, was quoted as saying: \"You can't use somebody's trademark, regardless of what you're saying, if you haven't been given permission.\"\nThe site responded with a statement: \"The site is purely satirical and is for entertainment. It contains no fact nor claims to do so. The site clearly states in its header, 'This site has absolutely no connection whatsoever with the Church of Scientology, it's affiliated organisations or, needless to say, Tom Cruise'.\" Stollery originally relented and agreed to change the domain name to \"passionofcruise.info\" on October 13, 2005, which E! News took to be a parody of the film The Passion of the Christ.\nAfter consulting with his lawyers in October 2005, Stollery responded to the Church with a far more aggressive stance. Now believing the accusation to be completely frivolous, Stollery publicly refused, challenging the Church with: \"I'm keeping my domain, see you in court.\" Again in an interview with ONE News, Stollery reiterated that he was going to retain rights to \"ScienTOMogy\", and not transfer the URL to the Church of Scientology, as they had requested. After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive \"annoying calls\" from local Scientologists. \"The first few I was stupid enough to answer, but now they just call and call and call. When I did speak to 'a church member here in Auckland' he kept insisting over and over that we meet to talk about my 'vendetta' with the church.\"\n= = Aftermath = =\nThe threats gave the Web site a cult following of its own, taking its normal traffic from one hundred hits per day to one million in a matter of hours. The Wall Street Journal carried reports commenting on the irony of the situation, noting the site's message that the press exposure due to the threats from the Church of Scientology had increased its traffic over tenfold. Mel Gibson has not raised objections to use of the parody term \"PassionofCruise\". E! News reported that though Stollery had originally agreed to take down the site, it was still running and accessible as of July 2006, when the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organization awarded Cruise rights to the domain name \"TomCruise.com\" over claims of a cybersquatter.\nIn addition to hosting the original cease and desist letter, the Berkman Center for Internet & Society also gives legal commentary on various issues pertaining to the \"ScienTOMogy\" controversy at a page provided by the organization Chilling Effects. They discuss \"trademark tarnishment\", which may occur if a non-owner of a trademark uses the work in an \"activity that is likely to offend the average person.\" However, the page also notes that the tarnishment would be non-actionable if the usage was non-commercial or parody. The Church of Scientology has not since filed a lawsuit or opened litigation on \"Scientomogy,\" though at present the site scientomogy.info was inactive. Internet Archive's Wayback Machine last version of the site is from July 8, 2007."

It was first released digitally in selected countries on June 2, 2008, by Def Jam Recordings and SRP Records. Launched to mark the first-year anniversary of the original album, Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded features three newly recorded songs and a DVD showing exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of Rihanna's worldwide tour, the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour (2007 – 09). For the new material, she worked with past collaborators Ne-Yo, StarGate, and C. \"Tricky\" Stewart, as well as Brian Kennedy, Mark Endert, Mike Elizondo, Mark \"Spike\" Stent and Maroon 5.\nGood Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the sound and production of the newly added material. However, other critics felt that the album was not worthy of re-release with only three new songs. Among other awards and achievements, the reissue's songs earned two Grammy nominations at the 2009 ceremony; \"Disturbia\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording, while \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" received a nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.\nFollowing its release, the reissue helped Good Girl Gone Bad re-enter several national charts. Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded sold 63,000 copies in its first week and helped the original album peak at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart. The reissue charted in New Zealand and peaked at number four; it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), denoting shipments of over 15,000 copies. Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded was promoted with four singles, including the US number-one hits \"Take a Bow\" and \"Disturbia\", and \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", which featured Maroon 5. To further promote the album, Rihanna performed songs from the reissue on several television programs and award ceremonies including FNMTV and the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.\n= = Background and release = =\nRihanna began working on her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007) in late 2006 and by late February 2007, the album was almost complete. Most of its songs were recorded in Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, parallel to the recording sessions for her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006). For the album's production, she worked with some of the producers who were involved on her previous albums, including Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken, Ne-Yo, J.R. Rotem, Sean Garrett, and Norwegian duo StarGate. Rihanna also collaborated with Timbaland and will.i.am for the first time. Following its release, Good Girl Gone Bad became a worldwide commercial success and reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number two on the US Billboard 200. It also received generally positive reviews from critics. The album's lead single \"Umbrella\" became a commercial success and reached number one on over fifteen national singles charts, including the Billboard Hot 100, which it topped for seven consecutive weeks, and the UK Singles Chart, which it topped for ten consecutive weeks.\nIn early 2008, Rihanna unveiled a new song titled \"Take a Bow\", which premiered on February 14, 2008 on the KIIS-FM radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest. MTV News reported that the track would serve as the lead single from Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, a reissue of the original album to mark its first anniversary. Rihanna further announced that apart from \"Take a Bow\", the expanded album would contain two more songs, one of which was a duet with American pop rock band Maroon 5, to supplement the original track listing. Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded was first released digitally on June 2, 2008 in certain countries, including Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The album was released physically on June 13 in Germany. On June 17, it was released in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A DVD containing behind-the-scenes footage of Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour (2007 – 09) was included in a special version launched in the US for a limited time. Rihanna subsequently hosted a promotion party for Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded in New York City, which featured several celebrity guests, including LeToya Luckett, Teyana Taylor, and Wynter Gordon.\n= = New material = =\nFour new songs were recorded for Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded: \"Disturbia\", \"Hatin 'on the Club\", \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" (with Maroon 5) and \"Take a Bow\". All were initially confirmed for inclusion on the album, though \"Hatin' on the Club\" was removed for unspecified reasons. The song was leaked online in January 2009 on Big Mike & DJ Neptune's R & B Kings Part Two mixtape.\n\"Disturbia\" is an uptempo electropop song. According to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine, it is reminiscent of Rihanna's 2007 single \"Don't Stop the Music\". McAlpine also noted that the song has a \"frosty-rave\" chorus accompanied with Rihanna's \"icy\" vocals. It was written by Brian Kennedy Seals, Chris Brown, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, \"Forever\", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that \"Disturbia\" would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced \"Disturbia\", while Makeba Riddick produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings about giving \"Disturbia\" to Rihanna: \"It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have\".\n\"If I Never See Your Face Again\" is an R & B song that incorporates a \"jagged\" use of synthesizers and \"buzzing\" guitars in its production. It was written by Adam Levine and James Valentine, two of the five band members from Maroon 5. It was produced by Mark Endert, Mike Elizondo, Mark \"Spike\" Stent, C. \"Tricky\" Stewart and Maroon 5. \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" was recorded by Stent at Conway Studios in Hollywood, Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank and Phantom Studios in Westlake Village. The song was mixed by Endert at Scream Studios in Miami, with assistance from Doug Johnson. \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" was originally included on the standard version of It Won't Be Soon Before Long without the inclusion of Rihanna, however, Levine stated in an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News while on set of the music video that he wanted to try something different for the album's re-release. He also said that he asked Rihanna to do some \"bits and pieces\" in the recording studio and that it came together very quickly. Levine stated that if there is \"magic\" between two artists, then \"you don't even have to think about it.\" In an interview with MTV's Total Request Live, Rihanna said that she was very excited about the collaboration with the band because she always \"loved them\" and their work.\n\"Take a Bow\" is an R & B song that tells of how the female protagonist expresses disinterest in rekindling her relationship with a dishonorable and unfaithful ex-boyfriend. The song was written by Ne-Yo, Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. Hermansen and Eriksen produced and provided instruments for \"Take a Bow\" under their production name, StarGate, while Smith co-produced the song. Rihanna's vocals were recorded by Eriksen at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City, Westlake Studios in Los Angeles and Parr Street Studios in Liverpool. The song was mixed by Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with assistance from Houghkirk.\n= = Singles = =\n\"Take a Bow\" was released as the lead single from Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded and fifth single overall from the two releases. The song was made available to purchase in media outlets, via Def Jam Recordings' website since March 14, 2008, and was later made available to download via iTunes Store on May 6, 2008.

It has been certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and sold over three million digital copies. The single also reached number one in Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler.\nThe Spanglish version of \"Hate That I Love You\" featuring David Bisbal, was released as the second single from the album on April 28, 2008, in certain countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Spain. The song peaked at number 37 on the Spanish Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for a total of two weeks. \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", the collaboration with Maroon 5, was released as the second single from Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded. It was sent to contemporary hit radio in the US on May 15, 2008. It reached the top twenty on over five national charts worldwide. The music video for the song was directed by Anthony Mandler and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California. According to Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian, the concept for the video was \"high-end erotica\".\nWhen the album was reissued, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, the head of Def Jam Recordings and suggested that she wanted to release \"Disturbia\" as the next single. Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, \"It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that.\" It was solicited to US contemporary hit radio on June 17, 2008, and was released as a CD single in the United Kingdom on July 22, 2008. \"Disturbia\" earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards. It peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and became a top-ten hit in over twenty countries worldwide. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for two consecutive weeks, and became Rihanna's third number one single from Good Girl Gone Bad and fourth overall on the Hot 100 chart. The music video for \"Disturbia\" was directed by Anthony Mandler and portrays Rihanna in various locations such as in a prison cell and gas chamber.\n= = Promotion = =\nTo further promote Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, Rihanna performed on several television programs and award ceremonies. She performed \"Take a Bow\" for the first time at the 2008 MuchMusic Video Awards held in Toronto, Canada in the MuchMusic's headquarters on June 15, 2008. On June 20, Rihanna appeared on Today's Concert Series held at the Rockefeller Plaza, New York City. She performed \"Take a Bow\" together with her 2007 singles \"Umbrella\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\". On June 27, she appeared on FNMTV together with Maroon 5. She sang \"Take a Bow\" before performing together on their collaboration \"If I Never See Your Face Again\". In July 2008, Rihanna performed the Spanglish version of \"Hate That I Love You\" with David Bisbal, at the sixth series of the Spanish talent show, Operación Triunfo.\nRihanna performed \"Disturbia\" for the first time at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. She performed it while revealing a leather \"goth inspired\" outfit. Together with the dance troops, she performed a Thriller-inspired dance in which glow sticks and leather props were used. On September 19, 2008, Rihanna visited France and performed \"Disturbia\" at Star Academy France. Rihanna sang \"Disturbia\" at the 2009 Super Bowl which was held at the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado. The performance of the song featured a sample from the White Stripes song \"Seven Nation Army\" (2003) and was accompanied by flames that shot up across the front of the stage.\n= = Critical response = =\nA reviewer from The National praised the material on the original album, particularly the \"ubiquity\" of \"Umbrella\", and also complimented \"Don't Stop the Music\", \"Hate That I Love You\", and \"Shut Up and Drive\". He further stated that the release of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded was made to mark the first year anniversary of the album and that \"the new tracks are everything you want pop to be, and are a testament to the power of the original record and to the new Rihanna.\" Spence D. of IGN reviewed the new material and wrote that \"Disturbia\" is built on an infective \"bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum...\" hook \"that sucks you into the detached electronic bounce of the track\". He said that \"Take a Bow\" is perfectly fitted for a \"post-break-up days of gloom\" and further praised Rihanna's vocals on the song. According to D., \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" is inspired by the works of American musician Prince and wrote that the \"Rihanna's presence [on the song] definitely gives it a nice boost\".\nJ. Edward Keyes of eMusic gave the album four out of five stars and wrote that the \"uber-futurist\" production of the release accompanied with Rihanna's \"Robo Dominatrix vocal approach — is a big reason the record works so well. Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded is all blue-light electronics and primal throb, 25th-century pop music in the here and now.\" Digital Spy's Nick Levine also gave Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded four out of five stars, but was skeptical about the choice to re-release the album, writing that \"it isn't worth forking out for Good Girl Gone Bad twice just to hear the new songs\". Despite that, he praised the newly added songs especially \"If I Never See Your Face Again\"; he called the song \"superior\". Levine further wrote, \"if Reloaded encourages a few hesitant pop fans to invest in this album, the closest thing to a Thriller that 2007 / 8 is likely to produce, this rather cynical reissue should be let off the hook... just.\" Among other achieved awards and nominations, \"Disturbia\" and \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" received nominations for Best Dance Recording and Pop Collaboration with Vocals respectively at the 2009 Grammy Awards.\n= = Commercial performance = =\nAfter the release of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, it was predicted that the reissue would sell between 45,000 and 50,000 copies in its first week in the US. For the week ending June 22, 2008, it sold 63,000 copies and helped the original version of the album to jump from number 124 to number seven on the US Billboard 200 in its 55th week. It also peaked at number five on the Top R & B / Hip-Hop Albums. With this, Good Girl Gone Bad got back in the top 10 for the first time since its debut in June 2007.

The track was written by Bieber and also co-written and produced by production duo Johntá Austin and Bryan-Michael Cox. It was originally released as a promo single from latter half of Bieber's debut album, My World 2.0 on March 2, 2010. The song charted within the top twenty in Canada and New Zealand, twenty-one in the United States, and in the lower regions of the charts in Australia and the United Kingdom, respectively. The accompanying music video features Bieber and Paige Hurd at the Atlantis Resort in The Bahamas, including scenes at the resort, an aquarium, and on the coast. Bieber performed the song a number of times, including on BET's SOS: Saving Ourselves - Help for Haiti Telethon, which benefited victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n= = Composition and critical reception = =\n\"Never Let You Go\" published in common time with moderate tempo. \"Never Let You Go\" written in D minor key with the chord progression B ♭ -Dm-C. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly noted similarities between \"Never Let You Go\" and Chris Brown's \"Forever\", calling the previous a \"fraternal twin\" to the latter. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, using \"Never Let You Go\" and \"Stuck in the Moment\" as examples said that \"the ballads — often a weak spot on pop / R & B records — are fully realized, mixing love-struck lyrics with big, lovable choruses.\" Lauren Carter of The Boston Herald stated that, \"While it ’ s hard to buy into so much angst coming from a 16-year-old, the promises of forever (see“ Never Let You Go, ” for starters) will undoubtedly delight the young girls who dream of spending eternity with pop ’ s newest heartthrob. \"\n= = Chart performance = =\n\"Never Let You Go\" debuted and peaked at number twenty-one in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100. It was listed on the chart for two weeks before dropping off. The song, like previous digital-only singles of Bieber's, had limited stays on the charts, and holds the record for the second all-time biggest week-to-week descent in Hot 100 history, behind Justin Timberlake's cover of \"Hallelujah\" and the Jonas Brothers' \"Pushin 'Me Away\". It debuted and peaked at fourteen in Canada, after spending four weeks on the Canadian Hot 100 it dropped off. Internationally, the song charted at sixty-seven in Australian Singles Chart, and reached sixteen on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it was on the chart for three weeks. Via digital sales behind the release of My World 2.0, \"Never Let You Go\" reached eighty-four on the UK Singles Chart.\n= = Music video = =\nRolling Stone confirmed in January 2010 that the music video had already been shot by director Colin Tilley while Bieber was at the Atlantis resort in Dubai. Actress Paige Hurd portrays Bieber's love interest in the video. The video premiered on March 30, 2010 on Vevo. It was the new joint on BET's 106 & Park on April 5, 2010.\nSummarizing the video, Jocelyn Vena MTV News said, \"Bieber is seen hanging out in the catacombs of Bahamian aquariums... In this new clip, Bieber is seen performing on the beach and frolicking with Hurd. Bieber is definitely growing up a lot in this video — sharing near-kisses, touching and nuzzling with her boyfriend. Shots of the pair in silhouette holding hands play into the video's plot of two young teens falling in love in a very exotic locale.\" Vena also said that Bieber continues her \"knack for Michael Jackson-esque dance moves.\" (read: bad mimicry and complete rip off of). Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the video \"So romantic,\" as \"they dance in an age-appropriate fashion.\" Chris Ryan of MTV News reviewed the video positively, stating that it is, \"a really nice take on the innocence of young love, full of flirting, dancing and hair-touching.\"\n= = Live performances = =\nBieber performed the song several times including at the new Microsoft Store grand opening in Mission Viejo, California, and in a live session with MTV.

It was written by Matt Groening and DJ Jazzy Jeff and recorded during the fall of 1990. The song was released as the second single from the album in early 1991 and an accompanying music video (directed by Gregg Vanzo) was broadcast on television on March 7, 1991. This video has since been released on DVD as part of the 2002 boxset The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season. \"Deep, Deep Trouble\" charted in several countries around the world, including the top ten in Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Critical reception of the song was positive and it has been praised for its humorous lyrics.\n= = Background = =\n\"Deep, Deep Trouble\" appeared on the successful 1990 album The Simpsons Sing the Blues that features songs sung by the characters from the American animated television series The Simpsons. It was recorded along with the rest of the album during the fall of 1990, at which point the cast members of The Simpsons were also recording the second season of the series. The song was written by The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and DJ Jazzy Jeff, and produced by DJ Jazzy Jeff and John Boylan. DJ Jazzy Jeff provided the drum programming, keyboards, and scratches on \"Deep, Deep Trouble\".\nThe song is a rap performed by the character Bart Simpson about his trouble-making antics. Groening has described it as \"the tragic story of Bart Simpson, a bad youth gone worse.\" The Simpsons cast member Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart on the show, provided the character's voice in \"Deep, Deep Trouble\" as well. The characters Homer Simpson and Maggie Simpson are also featured, with Homer ranting at Bart, and Maggie sucking on her pacifier to the beat of the song.\n\"Deep, Deep Trouble\" was released in early 1991 as the second single from The Simpsons Sing the Blues after \"Do the Bartman\", which also features Bart rapping. That single achieved much popularity, placing first on the singles charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and eventually becoming certified gold in the latter country with 400,000 units sold. In Ireland, \"Do the Bartman\" spent nine weeks at number one on the Irish Singles Chart — only seven singles have ever managed a longer run at number one there.\n= = Reception = =\nThe song received a positive response from critics. Sommer Swindell of the Observer-Reporter commented that \"after listening to [The Simpsons Sing the Blues] once, no one will forget 'Deep, Deep Trouble' [...] It would be hard not to crack a smile while listening closely to the lyrics, as they are very creative and humorous.\" Thor Christensen of The Milwaukee Journal wrote that Bart \"gets in a few good yuks\" in the song, and Walt Belcher of The Tampa Tribune reported that Bart \"raps out an amusing story about his misadventures while mowing the lawn\". The Orange County Register's Cary Darling noted that \"Bart turning his life into a hip-hop autobiography on 'Deep, Deep Trouble' is an absolute joy.\" Cartwright's rapping was praised by Tom Hopkins of the Dayton Daily News.\nThe single was a commercial success, reaching number one on the singles chart in Ireland. It charted in the top ten in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and outside the top ten in Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. \"Deep, Deep Trouble\" spent nine weeks on the chart in New Zealand, seven weeks on the charts in Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, five weeks on the Australian chart, and three weeks on the chart in Sweden.\n= = Music video = =\nThe music video for the single premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 7, 1991 together with the Simpsons episode \"Bart's Dog Gets an F\" of the series' second season. When \"Do the Bartman\" was released it was also accompanied by a music video, which ended up being nominated for Best Special Effects at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards and becoming the number one music video on the American network MTV.\nThe video for \"Deep, Deep Trouble\" illustrates the things Bart raps about in the song, showing how he is forced by Homer to mow the lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock at his father in his sleep. When Homer tells Bart to hurry up, Bart accidentally runs over the sprinkler and as a result he has to stay at home when the family goes to see a boat show. After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post thought the video was not \"nearly as clever as the cartoon\" and that it had \"'promotional gimmick' written all over it.\" \"Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. So what do I know?\", she added.\nThe music video features both original animation and old animation from the series and the Simpsons shorts that aired on The Tracey Ullman Show before they were spun off into The Simpsons in 1989. Gregg Vanzo directed the video, which, according to him, features quicker character poses than in episodes of the show to allow the animation to match the hip-hop beat. The music video was later included on the 2002 DVD boxset The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season, with audio commentary from its producers.\n= = Track listing = =\n= = Chart positions = ="

                "text": "= I Don't Remember =\n\"I Don't Remember\" is a song by Australian alternative rock band Powderfinger, from the album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. It made its radio debut on 9 July 2007 on Australian radio stations, and was subsequently released as a single and digital download on 4 August 2007 in Australia, 3 September 2007 in New Zealand, and 13 August 2007 in the United States.\nThe song was written by Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning, and influenced by bassist John Collins. The riff was then developed by guitarist Ian Haug. The song is about reconciling difficulties and arguments, rather than shifting the blame.\n\"I Don't Remember\" was lauded by some reviewers, who appreciated its energy, while other reviewers were more critical, dubbing it an \"advertisement song\". The music video also received critical acclaim, especially for the parodies it contained. Despite the reviews, the single charted poorly, reaching number 42 on the ARIA Singles Chart.\n= = Background, writing, and recording = =\nThe song was written by the band's lead singer, Bernard Fanning, following a night he spent drinking with bassist John Collins towards the end of the recording phase of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. The song was written by Fanning on guitar, but he later wrote the main riff on piano, which was then converted into a lead guitar riff performed by Ian Haug. The guitars for the song are all tuned down one step; while the guitar finger positioning is played as though in the key of C major, the detuning brings the key of the song down to Bb, with the song leading off with Bb's relative minor, G minor. During the recording phase, Fanning suggested \"softening\" the main riff by returning it to the piano, and even recorded this concept; however this piano version did not end up in the final album mix, nor was it included as a B-side on the single.\n\"I Don't Remember\" was recorded in Los Angeles during pre-production for Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. It contains a simple acoustic riff, similar to several songs on previous albums including Vulture Street. While recording the song in January 2007, Fanning said in an interview that:\nIt's a song about making mistakes and trying to reconcile what they were — but then in the end, in the wash up — it doesn't really matter whose fault it was, as long as it gets reconciled.\nThis meaning was also evident in the song's lyrics. In the second line, Fanning states that \"I made a mistake that I'll never surpass\", before explaining that it does not matter whose fault it is, in saying \"I know you needed someone to take the fall / I know you needed someone to blame it on\". In the second verse, Fanning again reiterates that he feels pain in the mistake that was made, when he says \"I found my heart and it broke like glass / I made that mistake that I'll never surpass\".\nJohn Collins said of the song:\nI hope the song sounds exciting, without sounding... big rock? Without sounding country, and sound interesting, 'cause I think that the basis of the song if you play it on the acoustic is there, and it's up to us [Powderfinger] to stuff it up now.\nWhen Powderfinger first played the song to Benmont Tench, who would feature in a piano role throughout the album, he remarked that it reminded him of Buffalo Springfield, who was an inspiration of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Fanning replied that \"we were thinking more of the Heartbreakers\", indicating the musical style intended in \"I Don't Remember\", but also paying homage to Tench, whom the band would work with extensively. Tench performed with the band on the album version of the song.\n= = Music video = =\nThe music video for \"I Don't Remember\" was made by Fifty Fifty Films, who had previously collaborated with the band on the videos for \"Like a Dog\", \"(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind\", and \"Lost and Running\", all nominated for ARIA Awards.\nThe music video starts on a school bus with children playing and throwing things, and features a young boy who then selects the track \"I Don't Remember\" on his iPod and closes his eyes. He then dreams about a school concert for a band called \"Littlefinger\", a parody of the band for which he is the lead singer \"Bernie\", a parody of Bernard Fanning. The band and audience are composed of primary school students. Children are seen offering a chocolate milk called smilo, a take on Milo, and a camera crew for \"Channel [Z]\" and reporter \"Su-Mi\". This is a parody of Yumi Stynes, a presenter from Australian music station Channel V. The end of the clip shows that it was a dream being had by the student who played the lead singer for \"Littlefinger\".\nMany elements of \"I Don't Remember\" 's video received positive critical response for the usage of children in it. Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph summarised critical feelings towards the video, by suggesting in her review that \"[maybe] bands should get kids to play them in videos forever\".\n= = = Parodies = = =\nPowderfinger portrayed as \"Littlefinger\".\nYumi Stynes portrayed as \"Su-Mi\".\nChannel V portrayed as \"Channel Z\".\nNews Ltd portrayed as \"News Unlimited\" on a T-shirt.\nBig Day Out portrayed as \"Little Day Out\".\nA sign posted says \"Sshhh!

Adams stated that \"'I Don't Remember' is not the next single without reason — it does everything you expect a Powderfinger single to, perhaps a more appropriate 'ad' for this album.\" Sputnikmusic contributor James Bishop described \"I Don't Remember\" as unoriginal, but at the same time said that it proved Powderfinger \"haven't forgotten how to write a good song\".\nAllmusic reviewer Clayton Bolger, however, described it positively as a \"stadium anthem\" and stating that it was a good example of the \"trademarks of classic Powderfinger\" showcased on the album. The review labeled the song a \"pick\". Web Wombat's review of the album also treated the song positively, dubbing it \"classic Powderfinger.\" Reviewer Andrew Tijs from CitySearch Brisbane stated that the song is \"a smoothly emotive jangle-rock tune with a purposeful chorus and Fanning's inimitable vocal\", though provides mixed reviews when compared with other songs by the group, noting that \"It's no eerie ballad like 'The Day You Come', nor does it have 'Like a Dog' 's snarl, nor' On My Mind '' s pub rock shudder.\"\n\"I Don't Remember\" was performed regularly on the Across the Great Divide Tour, generally with positive responses.

Hunter was formed in mid-1995 and was later disbanded at the end of 1997. The club was formed because of the Super League war, which was the rivalry between the traditional Australian Rugby League competition and the new media driven Super League competition. The team competed in the inaugural and only Super League season in 1997, as well as that year's World Club Challenge.\nThe Mariners faced much adversity in the Newcastle region because of the Australian Rugby League's Newcastle Knights team being already well established in the region. The club played its home games at Topper Stadium and missed out on the finals of the 1997 Super League season, but made the grand final of the World Club Challenge. The team was overshadowed by the Newcastle Knights who won the ARL competition and were admitted into the 1998 re-united competition. The Mariners were disbanded after being left out of the new competition because they believed that the Hunter region could not support two entities.\n= = History = =\n= = = Formation = = =\nThe New South Wales Rugby League competition (NSWRL) had been formed in 1908 as the first rugby league competition in Australia. There was a Newcastle based club in the first two seasons of the Sydney-based competition, but they eventually left to form their own Newcastle Rugby League competition. It was not until 1988 that another Newcastle based team was admitted into the NSWRL. In 1995, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) took control of the competition amid the beginning of the Super League war. It was then that News Limited began proposing and deliberating a rival rugby league competition and the twenty teams which competed in the 1995 ARL season were split between the Super League and ARL competitions.\nThe Newcastle Knights, the Newcastle-based team formed in 1988, aligned itself with the ARL and the new Super League competition was left without a Newcastle-based team. The Super League then established their own Newcastle-based team. The financially successful Newcastle Wests Leagues Club was given a licence to form a club for the 1996 inaugural Super League season.\nIn July 1995, it was officially announced that the Newcastle-based team would be called the \"Hunter Mariners\". However, in the middle of 1995, members of the Newcastle Wests Leagues Club did not want the club involved in the rebel competition, and the club held a meeting after 5,000 fans signed a petition objecting to the club ’ s involvement. After this, and when local unions became involved in the protest, the Leagues Club abandoned the licence. The club then became owned and supported by News Limited.\nIn early 1996, the Hunter Mariners club was officially launched, without a home ground, but on that same day the Super League was banned from running its rebel competition. Originally the Mariners were allowed to use the Newcastle Knights home ground Marathon Stadium by the Showground Trust, but the Supreme Court found that they had no rights to play there. The club eventually played at Topper Stadium, sharing the ground with the National Soccer League's Newcastle Breakers, and used over $1 million to upgrade facilities at the stadium. After an appeal in mid-1996, the Super League was officially allowed to run the competition, which began in 1997.\n= = = 1997 Super League Telstra Cup = = =\nThe Mariners lost their first three games of the premiership season, their first a narrow loss on their home ground. However, after the first loss at home, the Mariners were able to win seven consecutive matches at Topper Stadium. Despite this home ground record, Mariners were never able to win away from home. They lost all nine matches played away from their stadium, and subsequently missed out on the finals for the Super League season.\nThe Mariners were able to produce some representative players throughout their one season. Noel Goldthorpe and Robbie Ross were selected in the Super League Tri-Series and Goldthorpe scored the winning points for New South Wales in the final of that series. Tyran Smith, Tony Iro and Kevin Iro were all selected for the New Zealand representative team. While mid-year find Brett Kimmorley was the club ’ s sole selection for Australia in the Super League Test series against Great Britain.\n= = = 1997 World Club Championship = = =\nThe Super League had also begun a rugby league competition in England, and they had created a mixed competition, encompassing Super League clubs from Australia, New Zealand, France and England, known as the World Club Challenge. The 1997 World Club Championship was held in order to crown \"the best club in the world\". The Mariners were a part of Australasia ’ s group A and competed in England, before returning to complete the Australian part of the competition. The Mariners won all three games in England, over Paris Saint-Germain, Castleford and Sheffield. They returned home to again win the three games at Topper Stadium and therefore made the finals of the competition.\nThe finals system meant that they would have to play their finals match in England against English Super League club Wigan. The Mariners shocked the club and the league by winning 22 – 18. That score line would again be repeated in the grand final qualifier against Australian club Cronulla, another match the Mariners were expected to lose. But the Mariners were able to defeat the Australian Super League runners-up to take themselves to the grand final of the competition. Against the winners of the Super League grand final, Brisbane, the Mariners were blown away by the competition favourites. In what would be their final rugby league match as a club, the Mariners were down at half-time 26 – 4 and the final scoreline of 36 – 12 prevented the Mariners taking out a A $1 million prize.\n= = = Demise = = =\nThe agreement of the ARL and Super League was to unify and become one competition, to be known as the National Rugby League (NRL), was that only twenty teams would compete in the competition in 1998. This meant that three of the twenty-two teams from both competitions was to be demised with the addition of a new Melbourne based team. With the other Newcastle-based team, the Newcastle Knights winning the 1997 premiership, they were admitted into the new competition, however the NRL saw that two Newcastle based teams would not be financially viable.\nLate in 1997, the club was offered to merge with Gold Coast-based team the Gold Coast Chargers, which would be known as the Gold Coast Mariners and would be based in the Gold Coast. However the Gold Coast party withdrew late to go alone in the 1998 competition, and while the Mariners tried to do the same, they, along with South Queensland Crushers and Western Reds, were not admitted into the NRL competition, thus ending their tenure as a first-grade rugby league team.\n= = Representative players = =\nPlayers from the Hunter Mariners that have represented another teams while at the club include Australian international Brett Kimmorley and New Zealand internationals Kevin Iro, Tony Iro and Tyran Smith. Robbie Ross and Noel Goldthorpe also played for New South Wales in the State of origin.\n= = Players = =\nIn the Super League season, the Mariners used a total of twenty-nine players over the eighteen games.\n= = Records and statistics = =\n= = = Individual records = = =\nScott Hill, Peter Gregory, and Tony Stone share the record of playing all eighteen Super League games for the Mariners, being the players with the most first grade games. Nick Zisti, however is the Mariner's most prolific record holder, with the most first grade points for the team with 76 points. This encompasses the most tries for the team with nine as well as most goals with twenty. Zisti has the most tries and goals in a match with three and five scored respectively in a match. The Mariners have only had three representatives, Robbie Ross and Noel Goldthorpe represented New South Wales in the Super League Tri-Series while Brett Kimmorley represented Australia in the Super League test matches.\n= = = Team honours = = =\nTheir home ground success, winning seven from nine matches, was never able to attract decent figure crowds, their highest reaching 7,719. Compared with the Super League competition average of 12,347 and the nearby Newcastle Knights had an average of 14,257 home attendances. With crowds at these levels, the Mariners were unsuccessfully competing in the Newcastle area."

                "text": "= Beautiful Liar =\n\"Beautiful Liar\" (Spanish: Bello Embustero) is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé and Colombian singer Shakira. It was written by Beyoncé, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Stargate members Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, and produced by Stargate and Beyoncé for the re-release of Beyoncé's second solo album, B'Day (2006). The mixing of the song was done by Gustavo Celis. \"Beautiful Liar\" was released on March 14, 2007, by Columbia Records as the first single from the deluxe edition of the album. A Spanish and English mixed version of the song was produced and titled \"Bello Embustero\".\n\"Beautiful Liar\" is a mid-tempo song; musically, it is a melding of Shakira's Latin and Middle Eastern styles with Beyoncé's contemporary hip hop and R & B styles. Its theme is female empowerment; two female protagonists sing about being charmed by the same man, but instead of fighting over him, both ladies agree that he is not worth their time. The song was well received by music critics, who praised generally Beyoncé's and Shakira's collaboration. \"Beautiful Liar\" was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 50th Grammy Awards and the Spanish version was nominated for Record of the Year at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2007. It won an Ivor Novello Awards for Best-Selling British Song in 2008.\n\"Beautiful Liar\" was commercially successful. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and experienced the largest upward movement on that chart until 2008. The song peaked at number one in many European countries, including France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Its accompanying music video was directed by Jake Nava, incorporates belly dancing moves. \"Beautiful Liar\" won the Most Earthshattering Collaboration award at the 2007 MTV Video Music Award. The song was included on Beyoncé's set list during her 2007 The Beyoncé Experience world tour.\n= = Conception and recording = =\n\"Beautiful Liar\" was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was produced by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, \"This song is very simple. Most of the time we have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But if you do it right, you can make it work, and this song is an example.\" The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote a significant part of the lyrics and the melody.\n\"Beautiful Liar\" initially had a Spanish title and different lyrics. Hermansen re-titled it when he heard the line \"beautiful liar\" in one of the verses. When the production of the song was almost completed, it was presented to Beyoncé, who approved it. She added a few lines to the lyrics and recorded a solo version a few months before the release of the deluxe edition of B'Day (2006). Beyoncé confirmed that she would perform a duet with Shakira in an interview for Univision in December 2006. In another interview for MTV News, Beyoncé said that she met Shakira several times at various awards shows, and they talked about plans to collaborate on a song as they are both fans of each other and respect each other's work. Beyoncé said that she was very happy that they were able to work together after waiting for years.\nWhen Beyoncé invited her to record a song for the re-release of Beyoncé's studio second album, B'Day, Shakira was touring and consequently had difficulties to match her schedule with Beyoncé's. A few months later, Shakira agreed to sing on the track. As she recorded her vocals, the songwriters and producers added the ethnic strings and percussion break. Beyoncé and Shakira recorded their vocals in different studios; the vocals were engineered by Gustavo Celis. \"Beautiful Liar\" was recorded at Sony Music Studios and Battery Studios in New York City, Elastic Mix Studios and The Hit Factory in Florida, and Futura Productions in Boston, Massachusetts.\n= = Composition = =\n\"Beautiful Liar\" is a contemporary R & B and pop song, which is written in the key of G Phrygian dominant, and set in common time at a tempo of 96 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocal range spans from G3 to B ♭ 5. Anna Pickard of The Guardian found elements of Latino and bounce music. The song opens with Shakira's vocals accompanied by a piping, Middle Eastern figure, later joined by a mariachi-flavored horn section. Groaning noises can be heard in the background which complement the melody. The names of the two singers are then heard: \"Bee on say, be-on-SAY! Sha kee ra, Sha-ki-RA\". The verses are sung on a mid-tempo, strutting, hip-thrusting arrangement, accented by rapid, flamenco-like hand claps and guitar strums. The song also features Persian instruments such as, oud and ney.\nLyrically, \"Beautiful Liar\" speaks about two women who chose not to end a friendship because of a man who has cheated both of them. Its theme is one of female independence. Beyoncé told MTV News that \"Beautiful Liar\" is about female empowerment, in keeping with the theme of the album: \"It's about a guy who's kind of playing both of us, and instead of us arguing over the guy we say, 'Forget him. Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar.\" The chorus features the lines, \"Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight\" with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal. Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato, intense vocal approach throughout the song. Beyoncé sings the lines \"I didn't know about you then, till I saw you with him again\" earnestly while Shakira later adds \"I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing\". In the end, the female protagonists conclude, \"we can live without him\", referring to their cheating lover.\n= = Release = =\n\"Beautiful Liar\" was leaked onto the internet and appeared as an unpaid download in early February 2007. The song was sent to radio stations in the United States on February 12, 2007; it was added to rhythmic contemporary, contemporary hit radio, and urban contemporary playlists. \"Beautiful Liar\" was released as a CD Single in Australia on March 14, 2007, and on April 16, 2007, in the United Kingdom where it was released as a digital download two days earlier. In Europe, the song was released as a digital EP on April 14, 2007, and a maxi single on April 20, 2007. \"Beautiful Liar\" was later serviced as a digital EP in the UK and the US on May 20, 2007. Different versions of the song were produced; Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Don Omar recorded verses for one of the song's remixes, but this was not released. In the UK, most radio stations, including Radio 1 played an up-beat dance remix of \"Beautiful Liar\" by the Freemasons instead of the original mix. Celis produced and mixed a Spanish-language version, titled \"Bello Embustero\", with additional lyrical contributions by Rudy Pérez. The Spanish version appeared on some regional releases of the deluxe edition of B'Day in late May 2007.\n= = Reception = =\n= = = Critical response = = =\nNick Levine of Digital Spy awarded \"Beautiful Liar\" three stars out of five and wrote that it \"isn't as ridiculously overblown\" as previous collaborations of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey on \"When You Believe\" (1998) and Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion on \"Tell Him\" (1997). However, he added that \"it's as calculated as a wannabe page 3 model's decision to have a boob job\", and that an accompanying music video will keep fans happy. Ben Sisario of The New York Times called it a \"steamy track\". Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the singers \"have fun with the grand soap-operatics\" of the song adding that \"Beautiful Liar\" has \"cultural as well as musical resonance, furthering Beyonce's bilingual agenda\". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song \"is a minor letdown; Shakira's voice is too like Beyoncé's for a truly complementary tango\". On April 26, 2011, Gary Trust of Billboard magazine listed \"Beautiful Liar\" at the fourth position on his list of the 10 All-Female Hit Collaborations, calling it a \"female-bonding boy-bashing anthem\". Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz of the same publication ranked the song at number 22 on their list of \"Beyonce's 30 Biggest Billboard Hits\". In 2014, Emily Exton of VH1 placed the track on her list of Shakira's best duets, calling it a \"sexy ode to the men we know we can't trust\" and praising both singers for their complementing vocal performance.\nThe song was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. Its Spanish version was nominated at the 8th Annual Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year. In Europe, \"Beautiful Liar\" won the Best-Selling British Song at the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards. It was deemed eligible for the award because British songwriters Amanda Ghost and Ian Dench had worked on it.\n= = = Chart performance = = =\nImmediately after its release, \"Beautiful Liar\" reached number one on the iTunes best-seller list in March 2007. The song debuted at number 94 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart; most sales were digital downloads. The following week, it rose 91 positions to number three after 150,000 download copies were sold; this set a record for the largest upward movement in the history of the Hot 100 chart, until it was surpassed by Britney Spears's 2008 single \"Womanizer\", and Kelly Clarkson's 2009 single \"My Life Would Suck Without You\". On the US Pop 100 chart, \"Beautiful Liar\" rose from number 77 to number three. It is one of the few singles to debut at number one on both the US Hot Digital Tracks chart and US Hot Digital Songs chart. In mid-May, the song peaked at number one on the US Hot Singles Sales, becoming the fifth single from B'Day to accomplish this feat. \"Beautiful Liar\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in February 2009, denoting shipment of one million copies. As of March 2014, it has sold over 1,419,000 paid digital downloads in the US.\nOutside the US, \"Beautiful Liar\" reached number one in 32 countries. In the UK, the Freemasons remixed version of the song was widely promoted by radio stations, including BBC Radio 1, where it was put on the A-List. Two weeks before the CD release, the song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 10, based solely on downloads sales, which accumulated to 37,500 units in its first week. It became both Beyoncé's and Shakira's highest debut on the UK Singles Chart based on digital sales alone. After the physical release, \"Beautiful Liar\" reached number one, becoming Beyoncé's third UK number one single, and Shakira's second. It remained at number one for three weeks. On June 20, 2007, the song was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting sales of 400,000 copies. \"Beautiful Liar\" was 2007's 12th biggest-selling single in the UK. As of September 2014, the single has sold 430,000 units in the UK. In Australia, the song reached number five, and was the country's 51st best-performing single in 2007. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified \"Beautiful Liar\" platinum, denoting shipment of 70,000 copies. It debuted at number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart, and topped the Irish Singles Chart.\n= = Music video = =\nThe music video for \"Beautiful Liar\" was directed by Jake Nava, who directed several of Beyoncé's other videos. It was filmed over two days, during the two-week production of B'Day Anthology Video Album. Because of a busy schedule, the production team did not have enough time for the choreography. The dance sequences were choreographed spontaneously and the routines were rehearsed in forty minutes. Beyoncé learned some of the choreography from Shakira, who created most of them and taught Beyoncé some belly dancing moves. Beyoncé originated the idea of playing a lookalike after an experience when she saw a boy dancing, and thought he was performing before a mirror, but realized he was dancing with another person. The music video premiered on Total Request Live on February 28, 2007.\nThe first half of the video features Beyoncé and Shakira in separate scenes. It begins with the women's faces masked by smoke. As the video progresses they are featured against several different backgrounds, including dawn (Beyoncé) and dusk (Shakira); sheets blown in the wind; bamboo covered with yellow orchids; a room with blue neon lighting and Avestan writing on the walls; and a background of stormy weather. Slow dance moves and belly dancing, during a breakdown after the bridge, are featured throughout the video. The women wear matching hairstyles and black outfits for the entirety of the video.\nAlex Denney of Yahoo! Music wrote that the dance moves of Beyoncé and Shakira in the video were convincing and erotic \"without reaching the point of tackiness.\" He added that the music video \"is a real treat for men and women alike. The catchy beat and their lithe, sexy dance just provides an amazing entertaining video.\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy praised the \"gratuitous belly-wiggling\" choreography in the video. James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the music video \"is enough to give you whiplash\" due to Beyoncé's and Shakira's dance abilities. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the scene during the bridge of the song, where Beyoncé and Shakira \"begin mirroring each other's movements\". Anna Pickard of The Guardian praised the clothes of the singers, saying that they matched their \"mighty curves\", but criticized Beyoncé's dancing throughout the video. Erin Strecker of Billboard noted how the clip \"taught us all just how perfectly seductive the two could be\". \"Beautiful Liar\" was nominated for the Video Of The Year award at the 2007 BET Awards, but another Beyoncé video, \"Irreplaceable\" won it. At the 2007 MTV Video Music Award, it won the Most Earthshattering Collaboration, a new category in the awards show that year. Beyoncé received the award alone because Shakira was in Canada during the ceremonies.\n= = Live performances = =\nBeyoncé has never performed \"Beautiful Liar\" together with Shakira and the latter never performed the song live. Beyoncé's first and only televised performance of the song was during The Early Show on CBS on April 2, 2007 which was broadcast four days later. \"Beautiful Liar\" was later included on Beyoncé's set list during her 2007 tour The Beyoncé Experience. On The Beyoncé Experience, Beyoncé was dressed in a green belly dancing outfit and stood in darkness with dry ice billowing behind her. A microphone was then lowered from the ceiling and as she began singing the first verse, colored illumination was projected onto the backdrop. Beyoncé then performed several hip dance routines. Towards the end of the performance, pairs of female dancers, clothed in purple dresses, performed mirrored choreography. Beyoncé was accompanied by two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three backup vocalists called The Mamas and a lead guitarist, Bibi McGill. Throughout the performance Shakira appeared on the video screen on stage.\nWhile reviewing Beyoncé's performance at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, on August 5, 2007, Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote, \"Beyoncé needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes.\" Shaheem Reid of MTV News compared the performance with Michael Buffer further adding that \"Beyoncé acknowledged Shakira by shaking her hips rapidly\". While reviewing Beyoncé's performance of the song in Saskatoon on September 14, 2007, a writer of The StarPhoenix noted that it was one of the musical surprises during the evening. Jim Harrington from the San Jose Mercury News noted that Beyoncé's all-female band provided \"plenty of punch\" to the live performance of the song in Fresno on August 28, 2007 further noting that the singer looked like a \"sex kitten purring through\" the song. In Los Angeles, on September 2, Beyoncé performed \"Beautiful Liar\", dressed in a green belly dancing outfit, with several female backup dancers, and live instrumentation. \"Beautiful Liar\" was included on Beyoncé's live album The Beyoncé Experience Live (2007).\n= = Formats and track listings = =\nUS and UK Digital EP\n\"Beautiful Liar\" (featuring Shakira) – 3: 21\n\"Beautiful Liar (Bello Embustero)\" (Spanish Version) - 3: 22\n\"Beautiful Liar (Spanglish Version)\" (featuring Sasha Fierce a.k.a.

He has led the New Zealand National Party since 2006.\nBorn in Auckland before moving to Christchurch when he was a child, Key attended the University of Canterbury and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor of commerce. He began a career in the foreign exchange market in New Zealand before moving overseas to work for Merrill Lynch, in which he became head of global foreign exchange in 1995, a position he would hold for six years. In 1999 he was appointed a member of the Foreign Exchange Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York until leaving in 2001.\nKey entered the New Zealand Parliament representing the Auckland electorate of Helensville as one of the few new National members of parliament in the election of 2002 following National's significant defeat of that year. He has held the seat since then. In 2004, he was appointed Finance Spokesman for National and eventually succeeded Don Brash as the National Party leader in 2006. After two years as Leader of the Opposition, Key led his party to victory at the November 2008 general election, and repeated this feat at both the November 2011 general election and September 2014 general election.\nAs Prime Minister, Key leads the Fifth National Government of New Zealand which entered government at the beginning of the late-2000s recession in 2008. In his first term, Key's government implemented a GST rise and personal tax cuts. In February 2011, a major earthquake in Christchurch, the nation's second largest city, significantly affected the national economy and the government formed the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in response. In its second term, Key's government announced a policy of partial privatisation of five state-owned enterprises; while the policy was enacted, voters in a citizens-initiated referendum on the issue were 2 to 1 opposed to the policy. In foreign policy, Key announced the withdrawal of New Zealand Defence Force personnel from their deployment in the war in Afghanistan, signed the Wellington Declaration with the United States and pushed for more nations to join the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership.\n= = Personal life = =\nKey was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to George Key (1914 – 1969) and Ruth Key (née Lazar; 1922 – 2000), on 9 August 1961. His father was an English immigrant and a veteran of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Key and his two sisters were raised in a state house in the Christchurch suburb of Bryndwr, by his mother, an Austrian Jewish immigrant.\nHe attended Aorangi School, and then Burnside High School from 1975 to 1979. Then he attended the University of Canterbury and earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree in accounting in 1981. He has attended management studies courses at Harvard University.\nKey met his wife Bronagh when they were both students at Burnside High School. They married in 1984. She also has a BCom degree, and worked as a personnel consultant before becoming a full-time mother. They have two children, Stephie and Max. Max is the new night-time radio host for George FM, and is also a singer.\nOn 25 July 2008, Key was added to the New Zealand National Business Review (NBR) Rich List for the first time. The list details the wealthiest New Zealand individuals and family groups. Key had an estimated wealth of NZ $50 million. Key is the wealthiest New Zealand Member of Parliament.\n= = Before politics = =\nKey's first job was in 1982, as an auditor at McCulloch Menzies, and he then moved to be a project manager at Christchurch-based clothing manufacturer Lane Walker Rudkin for two years. Key began working as a foreign exchange dealer at Elders Finance in Wellington, and rose to the position of head foreign exchange trader two years later, then moved to Auckland-based Bankers Trust in 1988.\nIn 1995, he joined Merrill Lynch as head of Asian foreign exchange in Singapore. That same year he was promoted to Merrill's global head of foreign exchange, based in London, where he may have earned around US $2.25 million a year including bonuses, which is about NZ $5 million at 2001 exchange rates. Some co-workers called him \"the smiling assassin\" for maintaining his usual cheerfulness while sacking dozens (some say hundreds) of staff after heavy losses from the 1998 Russian financial crisis. He was a member of the Foreign Exchange Committee of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from 1999 to 2001.\nIn 1998, on learning of his interest in pursuing a political career, the National Party president John Slater began working actively to recruit him. Former party leader Jenny Shipley describes him as one of the people she \"deliberately sought out and put my head on the line – either privately or publicly – to get them in there\".\n= = Member of Parliament = =\nAuckland's population growth, as evidenced in the 2001 census, led to the formation for the 2002 General Election of a new electorate called Helensville, which covered the north-western corner of the Auckland urban area. Key beat long-serving National MP Brian Neeson (whose own Waitakere seat had moved on paper to being a Labour seat through the boundary changes) for the National Party Helensville selection. At the 2002 elections Key won the seat with a majority of 1,705, ahead of Labour's Gary Russell, with Neeson, now standing as an independent, coming third. Key won re-election with ease at the 2005 election garnering 63% of votes cast in Helensville, and increased his majority again in 2008, gaining 73% of the electorate vote.\n= = = Finance spokesman = = =\nIn 2004 the National Party Parliamentary leader Don Brash promoted Key to the Opposition front benches and appointed him the party spokesman for finance. In late 2006 Brash resigned as leader, citing damaging speculation over his future as the reason. His resignation followed controversies over an extramarital affair, and over leaked internal National Party documents later published in the book The Hollow Men.\n= = = Leader of the Opposition = = =\nIn his maiden speech as National Party leader on 28 November 2006, Key talked of an \"underclass\" that had been \"allowed to develop\" in New Zealand, a theme which received a large amount of media coverage. Key followed up on this speech in February 2007 by committing his party to a programme which would provide food in the poorest schools in New Zealand.\nHe relented on his stance in opposition to Sue Bradford's Child Discipline Bill, which sought to remove \"reasonable force\" as a defence for parents charged with prima facie assault of their children. Many parents saw this bill as an attempt to ban smacking outright. Key and Prime Minister Helen Clark agreed a compromise – giving police the discretion to overlook smacking they regarded as \"inconsequential\".\nIn August 2007 Key came in for criticism when he changed his position regarding the Therapeutic Products and Medicine Bill:\n\"John Key had finally slipped up. National's leader had told the Herald on Tuesday he would have signed up to a New Zealand First-initiated compromise on the stalled Therapeutic Products and Medicines Bill had he seen it – and was still willing to sign up – only to change his mind yesterday after his remarks appeared in print.\"\nAlso in August 2007, Labour's Trevor Mallard hinted in Parliament that Labour would try to link Key to the 1987 \"H-Fee\" scandal, which involved Key's former employer Elders Merchant Finance and a payment to Equiticorp Chief Executive Allan Hawkins. Hawkins and Elders executive Ken Jarrett were later jailed for fraud. Key forestalled the accusation by declaring that he had left Elders months before the event, that he had no knowledge of the deal, and that his interview with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) during the investigation into the affair could only have helped to convict the people involved. Then-SFO director Charles Sturt publicly supported Key's statement.\nLabour MPs criticised Key for not releasing specific policy information at their annual conference. Key responded that National would set its own policy agenda and that there was adequate time before the next election for voters to digest National Party policy proposals.\n= = = Prime Minister = = =\nKey became Prime Minister following the general election on 8 November 2008 which signalled an end to the Labour-led government of nine years under Helen Clark. The National Party, promoting a policy of \"change\", won 45% of the party vote and 59 of the 122 seats in Parliament (including a two-seat overhang), a substantial margin over the Labour Party, which won 43 seats.\nKey was sworn in as Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism and also appointed as a member of the Executive Council on 19 November 2008 with his new cabinet. His first international outing as Prime Minister was the 20th APEC meeting in Peru the following day.\nArriving at the Ngapuhi Te Tii Waitangi Marae the day before Waitangi Day 2009, Key was briefly shoved and grabbed by two protesters before diplomatic protection officers pulled them off. He told reporters he was \"quite shocked\" but continued onto the marae and spoke, while police took the two men away and charged them with assault.\nKey has also been tied with the National Cycleway Project since its conception at the national Job Summit in early 2009. He proposed it, and as Minister for Tourism, was instrumental in getting NZ $50 million approved for initial construction work.\nIn January 2009, after addressing Chinese New Year celebrations at the Greenlane ASB Showgrounds, Key tripped after coming down a small set of stairs in front of cameras leaving him with a broken right arm and \"embarrassed\".\n= = = Controversies = = =\nDuring his first term in office, National remained high in the polls and one commentator described support for John Key as \"stratospheric\". In 2011 he was nicknamed \"Teflon John\", as nothing damaging to his reputation seemed to \"stick\" to him. Coming up to the election in 2011, the gloss began to come off. In October that year, Key was caught up in a controversy over the replacement of 34 three-year-old Government BMW limousines with new ones at a time of economic restraint. Initially, Key denied any knowledge of the plan, although reports later surfaced showing that his office was aware of the deal. Key was accused of hypocrisy; he eventually apologised, calling it a 'sloppy' deal, effectively placing most of the blame on his chief of staff.\nThat same month, Key made a statement in which he claimed that Standard and Poor's had said that \"if there was a change of Government, that downgrade would be much more likely\". S & P contradicted the claim, bringing Key's credibility into question. National won the election, but New Zealand's credit rating was subsequently downgraded anyway – by two different agencies – Standard and Poor's and Fitch Group.\nThe real turning-point in the public's perception of Mr Key began with the teapot tapes. Just before the election in November 2011, a recording was made of a conversation between John Key and ACT Party candidate John Banks that they considered private – despite the fact that the meeting took place in a cafe and the media were invited to attend. Mr Key made a complaint to the police and compared the incident to illegal hacking in the News of the World scandal in Britain. He refused to answer media questions about what was said and the incident dominated media discussion in the days before the election. The unreleased recording allegedly concerns the leadership of ACT and disparaging remarks about elderly New Zealand First supporters.\nThe event causing perhaps the most embarrassment to John Key was the arrest of Kim Dotcom and the subsequent revelations that the New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) had illegally spied on Dotcom. As Prime Minister, John Key is directly responsible for the GCSB, which is not allowed to spy on New Zealand citizens – and Dotcom had been granted permanent residency. Three days later, the Prime Minister John Key apologised for the illegal spying. \"I apologize to Mr Dotcom. I apologize to New Zealanders because every New Zealander … is entitled to be protected from the law when it comes to the GCSB, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him.\" It subsequently came to light that deputy Prime Minister Bill English had been asked to sign a \"ministerial certificate\" suppressing details of the GCSB's involvement in the case while Mr Key was overseas – the only time this had been done in the last ten years.\nIn November 2012, Key told students at St Hilda's Collegiate in Dunedin that football star David Beckham was \"thick as batshit\". The comments were picked up by UK papers The Daily Mirror and The Sun. On the same day, there was controversy over Key's comments to a radio host that his shirt was \"gay\". \"You're munted mate, you're never gonna make it, you ’ ve got that gay red top on there\", he told host Jamie Mackay on RadioSport's Farming Show. The following day, Lord of the Rings actor Sir Ian McKellen said in a blog entry that Key should \"watch his language\".\nThe potential fallout from Dotcom's arrest continued in December 2012 when the High Court ordered the GCSB to \"confirm all entities\" to which it gave information opening the door for Dotcom to sue for damages – against the spy agency and the police. Later that month, John Key's rating as preferred PM dropped to 39% – the first time in his four years as prime minister that his rating had slipped below 40%.\nIn March 2013 it emerged that Key has known Ian Fletcher, head of the GCSB, since they were at school, but he denied that the pair were friends. But in early April it was revealed that Key had personally picked Fletcher for the role at the GCSB, encouraging Fletcher to apply for the role. Despite Key's office claiming Fletcher was \"the best candidate for the job\", Fletcher was in fact the only candidate interviewed. Key said he hadn't originally mentioned the phone call because he \"forgot\". Political commentator Bryce Edwards called it the \"most appalling political management since he became Prime Minister back in 2008\". Key was critical of reporting on the GSCB saga, calling journalists \"knuckleheads\" in a radio interview.\nIn April 2013 whilst visiting Chinese president Xi Jinping in Beijing, Key made headlines by suggesting New Zealand would back any United States or Australian military action against North Korea. The following day he backtracked, saying the chance of New Zealand troops entering North Korea was \"so far off the planet\".\nIn May 2014 Key justified the use of New Zealand intelligence that resulted in innocent civilians falling to American targeted killings.\nIn April 2015 a waitress claimed and Key acknowledged that he had pulled her ponytail multiple times over several months; when Key learnt she had taken offence, he apologised. International media have reported the incident as \"ponytail-gate\".\n= = = UN Security Council bid = = =\nKey launched New Zealand's campaign for a Security Council seat at the UN General Assembly meeting in September 2009. He met briefly with US President Barack Obama and former US President Bill Clinton. While in New York, Key appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman. He read out the Top Ten list, 'Top Ten Reasons You Should Visit New Zealand'.\nKey continued New Zealand's push for a spot on the Security Council while in New York in 2013. There he accused rival candidates Spain and Turkey of using aid money to buy votes from small African countries, and said New Zealand would not be spending its way onto the Council. While in New York, Key suddenly fell ill, but recovered in time for meetings with representatives from other countries ahead of the General Assembly.\n= = = Intelligence reform = = =\nOn 6 October 2014, John Key created a new ministerial portfolio called the Minister of National Security and Intelligence. The Minister of National Security and Intelligence will be responsible for setting national security and intelligence police and legislation, and will also head a newly established Cabinet National Security Committee. The Prime Minister will assume the new portfolio while the Attorney General Christopher Finlayson will assume the portfolios of Minister Responsible for the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) and Minister in Charge of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS), which have traditionally been held by the Prime Minister.\n= = Political views = =\nKey's views are largely aligned with his own party's view. However he also notes that his differences from his predecessor are more of style and focus rather than view. Key has in the past noted others' concern at the pace of asset sales, but argued that the arguments against selling assets in the 1980s were largely irrational. In a 2002 interview he said \"some form of orientation towards privatisation\" in health, education and superannuation, such as giving firms tax breaks for employer super schemes, made sense. After leading the National party to victory in the 2011 election, Key rejected that the National Party lacks a mandate to partially sell off state-owned assets, he acknowledged that some New Zealanders were anxious about the mixed ownership model. \"But I think we got a mandate.\"\nKey has a mixed voting record on social issues: he voted against the bill creating civil unions, claiming that this represented his constituents' views but he supports them personally. He was part of a large block of MPs voting to defeat a bill that defined marriage as being between a man and a woman. Key has also stated that he does not oppose gay adoption. He voted for the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013.\nIn 2008 Key voted for an ill-fated attempt to raise the legal drinking age from 18 back to 20 but subsequently ignored a Law Commission recommendation to increase levies on alcohol. He claimed there was' no appetite 'for such a move. A' suppressed 'report on public attitudes to alcohol law reform eventually came to light indicating that in 2010, when he made this claim, 56% of New Zealanders supported a price increase.\nKey says that he believes that global warming is a real phenomenon, and that the Government needs to implement measures to reduce human contribution to global warming. Key has committed the National Party to working towards reducing greenhouse emissions in New Zealand by 50% within the next fifty years. Commentators note that as recently as 2005, Key made statements indicating that he was sceptical of the effects and impact of climate change.\nCritics note that Key has changed his views on the Iraq war since becoming leader of the opposition. In 2003, as an opposition MP, Key emphasised National's position of supporting New Zealand's traditional allies, the United States and Australia. Key came under fire in the New Zealand Parliament in August 2007, when the Government claimed that had Key been Prime Minister at the time, he would have sent troops to Iraq.\nLike his predecessor Helen Clark, Key views a New Zealand republic as \"inevitable\", although probably not for another decade. \"If Australia becomes a republic there is no question it will set off quite an intense debate on this side of the Tasman,\" he said, \"We would have to have a referendum if we wanted to move towards it.\" Key later stated that he is a monarchist, and that a New Zealand republic would \"Not [happen] under my watch\". Key is a supporter of changing the Flag of New Zealand, and during the 2014 general election campaign promised a referendum on the issue. Following the election he stated he hoped the referendum would be completed in 2015.\n= = Religious views = =\nKey attends church frequently with his children, but is an agnostic. He has stated that he does not believe in an afterlife, and sees religion as \"doing the right thing\". Key's wife, Bronagh (née Dougan) Key, is the daughter of Northern Irish emigrants of mixed religious descent. Key is the third prime minister or premier of New Zealand (after Julius Vogel and Francis Bell) with Jewish ancestry."

                "text": "= Can't Be Tamed (song) =\n\"Can't Be Tamed\" is a song by American recording artist Miley Cyrus for her third studio album of the same name (2010). It was released on May 14, 2010 by Hollywood Records as the lead single from the record. The song was written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato, Tim James, Paul Neumann, and Marek Pompetzki, while production was handled by Armato and James. A Rockangeles remix version featuring rapper Lil Jon was included as a bonus track on digital editions of the album. According to Cyrus, \"Can't Be Tamed\" describes a desire to break out and experience freedom. The lyrics deal with the themes of freedom and self-expression, approached by sultry lyrics.\n\"Can't Be Tamed\" received generally positive responses by music critics. It also garnered commercial success. The song peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached its highest peak at number five on both the Irish Singles Chart and New Zealand Singles Chart. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Robert Hales and follows Cyrus performing with backup dancers throughout a museum. Cyrus is first trapped in a giant cage, being observed by spectators; she then escapes and trashes the museum. She has promoted \"Can't Be Tamed\" by performing it at several venues, including a performance on Britain's Got Talent that resulted in negative reactions from the media. The song is also a part of Cyrus' second and third world tours, Gypsy Heart Tour and Bangerz Tour.\n= = Background = =\n\"Can't Be Tamed\" was co-written by Miley, Antonina Armato, Tim James, Paul Neumann, and Marek Pompetzki and produced by Armato and James. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, \"it is about being a cage and people looking at you.\" As for others, she believed it could describe high school, in a situation where \"someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique and they want to be who they are. A relationship, or whatever, it is just breaking out and feeling free.\" Hollywood Records described \"Can't Be Tamed\" as \"a self-empowering song in which Miley asserts that she has to stay true to herself in relationships\".\nAt four meetings throughout Europe, Cyrus' manager, Jason Morey, presented the album Can't Be Tamed to representatives from Universal Music Group; the representatives confirmed what Hollywood Records in the United States had already decided, that the track would be released as the lead single. \"Can't Be Tamed\" premiered on April 30, 2010 on Cyrus' official MySpace page; it was officially released for airplay on May 3, 2010 and released as a digital download on May 18, 2010. In May 2010, Cyrus recorded the Rockangeles remix version of \"Can't Be Tamed\" with rapper Lil Jon at Rock Mafia Studios in Santa Monica, California. Lil Jon said the collaboration was \"crazy\" and thought audiences would enjoy the remix. Cyrus added, \"He just came in and let it out. It's pretty rockin.\" They believed Lil Jon gave the remix more energy than the original version had.\n= = Composition = =\n\"Can't Be Tamed\" is a length of two minutes and 48 seconds. The song has been described as \"grown-up club sound\". The song is set in compound time of 12 / 8 and has a fast tempo of 118 beats per minute. It is written in the key of B minor and Cyrus' vocals span two octaves, from A3 to D5. Cyrus belts her way through the choruses, while some lines in the verses feature processed vocals with the use of auto-tune. It follows the chord progression B5 – D – A. Driven by a dark, pounding beat and the heavy use of synths, \"Can't Be Tamed\" 's instrumentation relies on drum machine.\nWritten solely in first person, \"Can't Be Tamed\" explores the themes of freedom and self-expression, approached by sultry lyrics. It puts emphasis to how she cannot be changed or molded into being something she is not. In the verses, Cyrus addresses confidence and the attempt to discover for what she is yearning for, respectively. Choruses have Cyrus shouting the title and variations of it in a repetitive manner, against the beat of the song. Monica Herrera of Billboard interpreted the lyrics \"If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya / I'm not here to sell ya\" to be an official declaration of rebellion in order to dispose herself of tween role-model responsibilities. Likewise, various other critics believed \"Can't Be Tamed\" spoke of her completely drawing away from the image she had developed through Hannah Montana, which first aired in March 2006.\n= = Critical reception = =\nCritics typically reviewed \"Can't Be Tamed\" favorably. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly felt the song was \"not bad business for stationary cardio, but not the stuff year-end top tens are made of, either.\" She said it didn't offer \"major sensations\" and found it similar to Christina Aguilera ’ s \"Not Myself Tonight\" (2010). Greenblatt was also disappointed with the song's rhyming in the lines, \"I'm not here to sell ya '/ Or tell you to go to hell\". Sonya Sorich of Ledger-Enquirer said that while she anticipated some negative reception, \"Can't Be Tamed\" was also a prime candidate for a guilty pleasure dance track. \"Heather Phares of Allmusic referred to\" Can't Be Tamed \"as\" stomping \"and selected it as one of the album's best. Fraser McAlpine of BBC said that though the song has strong sexual undercurrents, Cyrus maintained classy throughout the track.\" If Miley's gonna weather the Ensexification Moment it'll be because she's doing it during a period of extrema GaGa, when videos are less about acreage of flesh and more about feathers and Victorian scientists. Oh, and because she's got the songs and the voice, that always helps \", McAlpine concluded.\nRob Sheffield of Rolling Stone rated the song three out of five stars and compared it to the musical styles of Rihanna. He added, \"It's no 'Party in the U.S.A.' or 'See You Again,' but the chorus packs plenty of electro-fizz pizzazz\". Bill Lamb of About.com rated \"Can't Be Tamed\" two and half out of five stars. He criticized the song for lyrics that headed into a \"selfish territory\", however, believing it would have airplay success. Monica Herrera of Billboard gave \"Can't Be Tamed\" a favorable review, writing, \"But Cyrus knows how to proffer her sass. When she sneers, 'I'm not a fake, it's in my DNA,' in pre-emptive retaliation against her critics, she does it with the professionalism of a Disney-groomed star.\" Jarett Wieselman of The New York Post said he liked the song and that though he did not buy Cyrus' \"Party in the U.S.A.\" (2009), he feared he would not \"be able to resist\" buying \"Can't Be Tamed\". He said the song had a \"naughty old school Britney Spears\" vibe, called it \"totally catchy\" and predicted it would be a summer hit. Ailbhe Malone of The Irish Times wrote, \"Miley ’ s taken a sexy electro-edge. Less\" Party in the U.S.A. \", more Party With My Parents Away, we like this. A LOT.\"\n= = Commercial performance = =\nOn the week ending June 5, 2010, \"Can't Be Tamed\" became the week's \"hot shot debut\" by entering and peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, selling 191,000 digital downloads. The sales marked Cyrus' second-best debut sales week, following \"Party in the U.S.A.\", which sold 226,000 digital downloads in its first week in August 2009. With the appearance on the chart, the song became her fourth top ten debut on the Billboard Hot 100, including a song credited to her alias Hannah Montana. In the following week, the song descended ten positions to number 18. It spent its last week on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week ending August 7, 2010, spending a total of ten weeks on the chart. \"Can't Be Tamed\" also peaked at number 16 on Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs). The song peaked at number six on the Canadian Hot 100 and spent a total of 14 weeks upon the chart. It also sold over a million copies in the US and was certified platinum by the RIAA.\nThe song also achieved commercial success in Australia and New Zealand. \"Can't Be Tamed\" debuted at number 18 on the Australian Singles Chart on the week ending June 6, 2010. After six weeks of ascending the Australian Singles Chart, the song found a new peak at number 17. In the succeeding week, it reached its peak at number 14 and spent 11 weeks on the chart. The single was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipping over 35,000 copies. On the week ending May 24, 2010, \"Can't Be Tamed\" debuted and peaked at number five on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It spent nine weeks ascending and descending the New Zealand Singles Chart before completely dropping from the chart on the week ending July 19, 2010. In Japan, \"Can't Be Tamed\" debuted at number 53 and peaked at number 12. In the United Kingdom, \"Can't Be Tamed\" debuted and peaked at number 13 on the week ending June 12, 2010. It spent eight weeks on the UK Singles Chart. The song peaked at number five on the Irish Singles Chart. In mainland Europe, \"Can't Be Tamed\" maintained similar outcomes. It became Cyrus' best-charting single on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles, peaking at number 15 in July 2010 and surpassing \"Party in the U.S.A.\", which peaked at number 17 in January 2010. It peaked at number 15 on the French Singles Chart, number 15 on the Norwegian Singles Chart, and number 14 on the Spanish Singles Chart. It also charted within the top 30 in Austria and Germany and within the top 40 of Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia).\n= = Music video = =\n= = = Background = = =\nThe music video for \"Can't Be Tamed\" 'was directed by Robert Hales. The dance routines were choreographed by Jamal Sims, who also choreographed Cyrus' \"Hoedown Throwdown\". Cyrus and Sims conceived the plot for the video together and proposed it to Hales, who \"envisioned it the way [they] did\". In regards to the video's theme, Cyrus explained, \"I think the video explains my life but it doesn't exclude other people's lives. It's not just about how fabulous and glamorous and all this. It's about the core of 'I don't wanna be in a cage. I want to be free and do what I love'\". The video was meant to transition Cyrus away from the good-girl image she had developed through Hannah Montana. However, she believed her fans would be able to identify with the video's message through their own circumstances; for example, she believed that her desire to \"stand out [rather] than fit in\" was shared by teenagers hoping to break out of high school cliques. In an interview with the singer, Ryan Seacrest noted the video's strong sexual appeal. Cyrus agreed that the video was sexy, though it was not supposed to be the premise: \"The video isn't about being sexy or who can wear the less clothes [...] It's about explaining the song and living the lyrics.\" The music video has been viewed over 100 million times on vevo.\n= = = Development and synopsis = = =\nThe music video was shot on April 10 and April 11, 2010 at Sony Studios in Culver City, California. Over twenty female and twenty male backup dancers were used. The video casts Cyrus as an exotic songbird breaking out of its cage, symbolizing Cyrus as a singer breaking out of her good-girl image. Prior to the shoot, Cyrus meticulously recorded her ideas for the video on paper. For example, she chose her back-up dancers make-up pallets and contemplated their outfits; while she did not want her dancer's bodies \"to look like normal bodies\", she also did not want for them to wear scales as, according to her, it would make them resemble to be fish and look scary. Hales wanted Cyrus to resemble a bird without \"actually having a beak\" or otherwise being overly explicit, so Cyrus' stylists invented bird-like accessories. Among these were arm bands with long leather straps, feathered shoulder pads, and a feathered vest worn over a black leotard and thigh-high black leather boots. Cyrus said she had originally worn a \"completely different\" outfit, but wasn't \"feeling it\" the morning of the shoot. \"So we made this one right there in the morning, and we added pieces throughout the day... more leather and more feathers. I think it's really fun and kept changing the look,\" she said. Cyrus' make-up artist, Denika Bedrossian, focused on the singer's eyes; he used \"rich jewel-toned shades\" and eyelashes with feathered tips to give Cyrus a \"deep peacock eye\". In cut-scenes, Cyrus wears a corset made of 2,400 silver metal pieces and numerous peacock feathers. It was designed by The Blonds, debuted during their fall 2010 fashion show, and cost $25,000.\nThe video commences with formally dressed spectators entering a museum as a curator introduces \"a creature so rare it was believed to be extinct. In captivity for the first time, the rarest creature on Earth, Avis Cyrus. White curtains are pulled down to reveal Cyrus, dressed in a black leotard and expansive black CGI wings, asleep in a giant bird nest locked inside a giant cage. Cyrus rises and approaches the audience, but a camera flash startles her and causes her to shield her face with her wings. The music starts, and Cyrus unveils herself again and joins a large group of feathered dancers. As Cyrus sings, she and the dancers escape the cage and prowl the museum, shattering museum exhibits as they pass them. They perform provocative dances both inside the cage and in darkened museum halls. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus lying down, dressed in a silver corset attached to a bed of peacock feathers, or writhing alone in her nest in the cage. The video ends with Cyrus back in her cage and the museum empty and trashed.\n= = = Reception = = =\nThe video premiered on May 4, 2010 on E! News. The video received generally positive reviews from critics. It also received numerous comparisons to videos by Britney Spears and Lady Gaga, though Cyrus said she \"wanted it to be something different for a female artist\". Cristina Gibson of E! described the video as \"edgy\", similar to Cyrus' video for \"Party in the U.S.A.\", but \"on steroids\". Tina Warren of MTV News said the video was a good step toward ridding Cyrus of her good-girl image and gave the video a positive review, calling it \"intriguing\" and stating, \"The video [...] is actually quite magnetic and you can ’ t look away\". Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly agreed. While he acknowledged the video \"might be dark and a tad conceptually racy\", he claimed it was smart move. \"She isn ’ t moving too fast, honestly [...] it ’ s not like Miley is stripping or baring much skin\". Rather, Stransky said Cyrus had \"some super-fun dance moves\" and \"[made] a statement\", albeit a darker one. Chinese newspaper People's Daily said the video featured \"bold\" costumes and \"revealed Cyrus' sexy side\". The website, Yahoo! added the video to the list of \"Worst Music Videos of 2010\" Daniel Rutledge of 3 News in New Zealand said Cyrus had made \"it very clear she wishes to cast aside any resemblance to the Disney alter ego that made her famous and be regarded from now on as an adult singer.\" Singaporean newspaper My Paper defended Cyrus against claims that the video was too provocative and reported, \"If nothing else, this vid shows that Cyrus knows how to entertain, and marks the beginning of truly high-quality videos.\" Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon.com offered a contrary opinion, stating that while Cyrus is a \"talented singer [who] deserves to break out of her Disney mold\", the \"Can't Be Tamed\" music video was poor. Williams said Cyrus has \"talent galore\" and \"incredible pipes\", but her video was \"predictable, derivative and dumb\" due to its unoriginality. According to People magazine, online reaction to the music video has been greatly varied. \"Fans and bloggers lit up the Web with comments ranging from 'stunning, gorgeous, fierce' to 'wow way too much for someone her age'\", the magazine reported. NME put the video at number 28 on their list of the \"50 Worst Music Videos Ever\".\n= = Live performances = =\nCyrus first performed \"Can't Be Tamed\" live on May 18, 2010 on Dancing With the Stars. Donning the black leotard and accessories used in the music video, Cyrus appeared in a human-sized cage and then performed throughout the stage with many costumed backup dancers; Cyrus' dancing was minimal. Her first performance of the song outside the United States was at the Rock in Rio concert in Lisbon, Portugal on May 29, 2010. Cyrus appeared on June 1, 2010 at the Paris, France nightclub 1515 Club and on June 3, 2010 on Britain's Got Talent's semifinals to perform \"Can't Be Tamed\". On the latter, Cyrus wore hot pants, fishnets and boots as she performed. Midway through the performance, Cyrus grabbed a female backup dancer, dipping her low, and simulated a kiss. The performance was met with negative reactions from the media and caused her to release a statement in which Cyrus promised she did not kiss the backup dancer. Cyrus wrote, \"It is ridiculous that two entertainers can ’ t even rock out with each other without the media making it some type of story. I really hope my fans are not disappointed in me because the truth is I did nothing wrong. I got up there and did my job which is to perform to the best of my ability.\" Cyrus later performed the song at the Rock in Rio concert in Madrid, Spain and the London, England nightclubs Heaven and G-A-Y. She has performed the track on Good Morning America, Late Show with David Letterman, MuchMusic Video Awards, and concert at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, California, which was streamed across over thirty websites owned by MTV Networks.\nCyrus performed the song during the Gypsy Heart Tour. She also performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. She wore a black sequined bra and furry monochrome chaps with falconry gloves during the performance. She was also accompanied by an enormous replica of her dog, Floyd. The performance received positive reviews from critics.\n= = Release history = =\n= = Charts = =\n= = Certifications = ="
