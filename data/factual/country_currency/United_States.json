                "text": "= Wildfire (Silver Dollar City) =\nWildfire is a steel roller coaster located at Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri. The $14 million ride was built by Swiss firm Bolliger & Mabillard and opened in 2001. Wildfire is themed as a flying machine developed by an 1880s Ozark inventor.\nStanding 120 feet (37 m) tall and featuring a top speed of 66 miles per hour (106 km / h), Wildfire is the tallest and second fastest ride at Silver Dollar City. Along its 3,073 feet (937 m) of track, Wildfire features five inversions including an Immelmann loop, a vertical loop, a cobra roll and a corkscrew.\n= = History = =\nIn July 2000, Silver Dollar City announced that they would be adding the Wildfire roller coaster to their park in 2001. At a cost of $14 million, the ride would be the most expensive attraction in the park's history. At the time of the announcement, construction was already underway on an undeveloped portion of land in the outskirts of the park. All of the ride's footings were in place with some of the steel supports already erected. Construction was expected to be completed in early January the following year, leaving three months for testing, landscaping and theming. On April 4, 2001, Wildfire officially opened to the public.\n= = Characteristics = =\nThe 3,073-foot-long (937 m) Wildfire features five inversions including an Immelmann loop, a vertical loop, a cobra roll, and a corkscrew. The park's existing terrain (situated on the Ozark Mountains) is utilised to allow a 120-foot-tall (37 m) lift hill to be translated into a first drop stretching 155 feet (47 m). Riders reach a top speed of 66 miles per hour (106 km / h) on the 2-minute, 16-second ride. The track was manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators located in Batavia, Ohio. Wildfire operates with two trains (generally with one train loading / unloading while the other runs the course, each featuring eight cars. Each car seats riders four abreast with ratcheting over-the-shoulder restraints. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,300 riders per hour.\nWildfire is located in the \"Hugo's Hill Street\" district of Silver Dollar City. It is themed around the story of an 1880s Ozark inventor named Dr. Horatio Harris. Harris has an aim to create a powered flying contraption for flight across the Ozark Mountains. Wildfire is the fuel he developed for his flying machine. The ride's queue and station area are modelled as the laboratory and invention warehouse of Harris. Riders eventually board his Wildfire-powered flying machine, the steel roller coaster. One year after the opening of the roller coaster Silver Dollar City began selling the Wildfire Burger, a hot and spicy hamburger, themed after the ride.\n= = Ride experience = =\nThe train leaves the station, takes a 180 degree right turn and climbs up the chain lift hill to 120 feet (37 m). At the top, the train turns 90 degrees to the left before negotiating the first drop of 155 feet (47 m). This is followed by an Immelmann loop, a vertical loop and a cobra roll, the latter of which inverts riders twice. Then the train heads up a banked curve into a corkscrew and a 230 degree turn into the final brake run.\n= = Reception = =\nRick Baker, Silver Dollar City's vice president of corporate development and design, expected the addition of the ride would increase season pass sales by 9% to 250,000. In 2001, the park was visited by a total of 2.1 million people.\nIn Amusement Today's annual Golden Ticket Awards, Wildfire ranked in the top 50 steel roller coasters three times. In 2003 it debuted at position 40, before dropping to 46 in 2004 and 49 in 2005. As of 2012 it has not returned to the listing.\nIn Mitch Hawker's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll, Wildfire entered at position 47 in 2001, before peaking at 45 in 2005. It hovered in positions around 60 before dropping to 96 in 2012. The ride's ranking in the poll is shown in the table below."

                "text": "= Money Inc. =\nMoney Inc. was a villainous professional wrestling tag team in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from February 1992 to August 1993. The team consisted of \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.). They held the WWF Tag Team Championship three times, defeating the Legion of Doom, the Natural Disasters and the Steiner Brothers for the title. In addition they had a feud with the Mega-Maniacs (Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake). After Money Inc. split up, DiBiase and Schyster were reunited in two stables, the Million Dollar Corporation and the New World Order, and have made several television appearances during special episodes of Raw.\n= = Career = =\n= = = Formation = = =\nBoth DiBiase and Schyster had gimmicks that focused on money. Schyster, whose initials spelled I.R.S., portrayed an evil tax accountant. DiBiase had used the gimmick of an arrogant millionaire in the WWF since 1987. He called himself the \"Million Dollar Man\" and created his own championship belt, the Million Dollar Championship. He was involved in angles that included purchasing the WWF Championship and paying wrestlers and fans to perform demeaning tasks. The WWF creative team decided that the two characters fit well together and made the decision to pair them together in late 1991. In February 1992, a storyline began in which Jimmy Hart, who had been managing The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon), turned against his team. In return for a bribe, he gave his team's contract for a WWF Tag Team Championship match against Legion of Doom (LOD) to Money Inc.\n= = = Tag Team Championships = = =\nDiBiase and Schyster, managed by Hart, defeated LOD at a house show on February 7, 1992 in Denver, Colorado, to win the title. This title win was unusual for professional wrestling, as Money Inc. had not yet debuted as a team on WWF television programming. In addition, the decision to give the championship belts to Money Inc. was made in a hurry, as LOD's Hawk had failed a drug test. The wrestlers were unaware until that night that the title would change hands, and Money Inc. 's win was not immediately acknowledged on television, as WWF programming was taped in advance. The Natural Disasters, upset by Hart's assistance to a rival tag team, fired Hart as their manager and turned face, beginning a feud with Money Inc. over the WWF Tag Team Championship.\nNot wanting to carry two championship belts, Ted DiBiase returned the Million Dollar Championship to the WWF, telling an executive that he would no longer appear with the belt. Money Inc. defended their tag team title against The Natural Disasters at WrestleMania VIII on April 5 and lost the match by countout. Because titles can only change hands via pinfall or submission, Money Inc. retained the belts. Over the next few months, the teams faced each other in rematches on television and at house shows, but Money Inc. managed to retain the title.\nAfter Hawk's suspension ended, the Legion of Doom was given a rematch against Money Inc. at SummerSlam 1992. The match was promoted as a championship bout, but the Natural Disasters beat Money Inc. for the title a month before the pay-per-view. At SummerSlam on August 29, the Legion of Doom won the match when Animal pinned DiBiase.\nAt the October 13, 1992 Wrestling Challenge taping, Money Inc. faced The Natural Disasters in a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The match originally pitted the Disasters against the Nasty Boys, who were also managed by Hart, but at the last minute, Hart replaced them with Money Inc. Because of this, the Nasty Boys split with Hart and attacked Money Inc. before the match. Later on, the Headshrinkers interfered on behalf of Money Inc. and helped DiBiase make Earthquake submit to the Million Dollar Dream, thereby winning Money Inc. the Championship. After the match, the Nasty Boys again attacked Jimmy Hart. At the 1992 Survivor Series on November 25, Money Inc. and the Beverly Brothers faced the Nasty Boys and the Natural Disasters in an 8-man elimination tag team match. During the match, Money Inc. eliminated the Natural Disasters, but Jerry Sags of the Nasty Boys then pinned I.R.S. to win the match. This was the only major victory The Nasty Boys got over Money Inc., as they failed to win the tag team title in several shots on television and at house shows in late 1992 into early 1993.\n= = = Feud with The Mega-Maniacs = = =\nOn the February 15, 1993 airing of Monday Night Raw, Ted DiBiase wrestled against Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake. Beefcake had sustained a real-life injury to his face in 1990. While Beefcake was wrestling his first match in two and a half years, DiBiase and Schyster attacked him. DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to hit him in the face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart repeatedly got in the way before Schyster shoved him out of the ring. I.R.S. then hit Beefcake in the face with the briefcase. Hart justified his face turn by claiming that he felt the need to \"step up and do the right thing\" and that he \"had a change of heart\".\nShortly thereafter, Hulk Hogan made his return to WWF television, and he teamed with Beefcake to form The Mega-Maniacs with Hart as their manager. Hogan and Beefcake challenged Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania IX. During the match, the referee sustained a kayfabe injury and was knocked unconscious. Hart jumped into the ring, turned his jacket inside-out to reveal black and white stripes similar to a referee's shirt, and made the three-count to give the match to The Mega-Maniacs. Hogan, Beefcake, and Hart celebrated by opening Schyster's briefcase and throwing his money into the crowd. A second referee then appeared, and the Mega-Maniacs were disqualified because Hogan had used Beefcake's steel face protector as a weapon.\n= = = Final Tag Team Championship = = =\nMoney Inc. feuded with The Steiner Brothers in the spring of 1993. At the 1993 King of the Ring, The Steiner Brothers and The Smokin 'Gunns defeated Money Inc. and The Headshrinkers in an 8-man tag team match. The following day, June 14, 1993, the Steiners defeated Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Two days later, Money Inc. regained the titles, only to drop them back to the Steiners three days later. Although Money Inc. received several rematches, they were unable to win the belts back from the Steiners.\nAfter failing to regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, Money Inc. began a feud with Razor Ramon. DiBiase had been making fun of Ramon over his upset loss to the 1-2-3 Kid, and even offered Ramon a job as his servant. Ramon was furious with DiBiase and turned face during their feud. Soon after, Ramon distracted DiBiase in a match against the 1-2-3 Kid, causing the Million Dollar Man an embarrassing loss of his own. At SummerSlam 1993, Razor Ramon defeated Ted DiBiase in what would be DiBiase's last WWF match. Later in the event, I.R.S. defeated the 1-2-3 Kid. DiBiase went on a leave of absence for several months, and Schyster returned to singles competition, feuding with Ramon.\n= = Reunions = =\nMike Rotunda, who portrayed Schyster, and Ted DiBiase continue to be close friends in real life, and they have reunited on several occasions following the disbanding of Money Inc. In 1994, DiBiase formed the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. Schyster was one of the first wrestlers to join the group and remained in the stable until leaving the WWF in 1995. In 1996, DiBiase and Rotunda (the latter as V.K. Wallstreet) were briefly together again in World Championship Wrestling as members of the New World Order.\nMoney Inc. made a surprise one-night return at Raw Family Reunion on October 9, 2006. They joined Arn Anderson and Rowdy Roddy Piper to assist Ric Flair, who was facing Mitch. They prevented the rest of Mitch's Spirit Squad from getting involved in the match, helping Flair secure the victory.\nAt the 15th Anniversary special edition of Monday Night Raw on December 10, 2007, Money Inc. had a brief reunion during a 15-man over-the-top-rope battle royal. After I.R.S. was the last man standing out of the 14 wrestlers that made it to the ring, DiBiase came out as the 15th entrant and paid I.R.S. to eliminate himself. As a result, DiBiase was named the winner of the match. They were also reunited on an episode of RAW in 2010 where they fought with fellow legends after a match between DiBiase's son Ted DiBiase and Christian.\n= = In wrestling = =\nDouble-team signature moves\nAssisted abdominal stretch\nDouble back elbow strike\nDiBiase's finishing moves\nMillion Dollar Dream (Cobra clutch)\nSchyster's finishing moves\nWrite-off (Flying clothesline to an oncoming opponent)\nManagers\nJimmy Hart\n= = Championships and accomplishments = =\nWorld Wrestling Federation\nMillion Dollar Championship (1 time) – Ted DiBiase\nWWF Tag Team Championship (3 times)\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nPWI ranked them No. 61 of the 100 best tag teams during the \"PWI Years\" in 2003"

She won $28,725 (equivalent to about $254,000 as of 2016) as well as 17 races. As a broodmare, she produced, or was the mother of, the first American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) Supreme Champion, Kid Meyers. She was the mother of three other foals, and was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 2009.\n= = Early life = =\nMiss Meyers was a chestnut-colored mare born in 1949 and sired, or fathered, by Leo, a member of the AQHA Hall of Fame. Miss Meyers' dam, or mother, was Star's Lou. Star's Lou's father was Oklahoma Star P-6, another AQHA Hall of Fame member. She was bred by O. C. Meyer, and later owned by Bruce A. Green.\n= = Race career = =\nMiss Meyers raced from 1952 until 1955 and won seven stakes races, placing second in seven others, and third in two more. She won 17 of her 59 starts on the racetrack. She placed second in another 15 races and third in 5. Her total earnings on the track were $28,727 (approximately $253,800 in 2016 dollars). Among her wins in stakes races were the 1952 Buttons and Bows Stakes, the 1953 California Championship, the 1953 Billy Anson Stakes, the 1953 Rocky Mountain Quarter Horse Association World Championship Dash, the 1955 Bart B Stakes, the 1955 Barbara B Stakes and the 1955 Traveler Stakes. She set four track records, twice at 350 yards (320 m), once at 400 yards (370 m), and once at 440 yards (400 m). In 1953 she was named the AQHA World Champion Quarter Running Horse, as well as the High Money Earning Horse; the AQHA also awarded her the title of Superior Race Horse in 1954. The highest speed index she achieved, a measure of how fast she was able to run, during her racing career was AAAT, the highest possible at the time. It was not until she was a four-year-old, during 1953, that Miss Meyers performed well and started winning on the track. That year she won $15,398 (approximately $136,200 in 2016) dollars, over half her lifetime earnings, as well as seven of her seventeen career wins.\n= = Broodmare and legacy = =\nAfter Miss Meyers retired from the racetrack, she became the dam of the first AQHA Supreme Champion, Kid Meyers, sired by fellow Hall of Famer Three Bars, a Thoroughbred. (A Supreme Champion is a horse that is outstanding on the racetrack, as a riding horse at horse shows and also conformationally, or how well put together the horse is). Kid Meyers was a 1963 sorrel stallion, and had 23 starts on the racetrack, winning 6 times. He earned a total of $10,655 (approximately $77,700 as of 2016 dollars) on the track. After retiring from the racetrack, he earned his AQHA Champion in 1966 and his AQHA Supreme Champion in 1967. His highest speed index was AAA. Unlike most foals, who nurse for months after birth, Kid Meyers was orphaned at the age of one month in March 1963.\nMiss Meyers had three other foals. Oh My Oh, a 1957 bay mare sired by the Thoroughbred stallion Spotted Bull, started 30 times, winning eight races for a total earnings of $12,592 (approximately $99,700 as of 2016 dollars) and coming in second in a stakes race. She earned an AAAT speed index. As a broodmare, she was the dam of All American Futurity winner Three Oh's. Miss Meyers' 1958 foal was Mr Meyers, a sorrel stallion sired by fellow Hall of Famer Go Man Go, who started 41 times, winning 9 times and placing third in four stakes races. His total race earnings were $25,656 (approximately $200,700 as of 2016 dollars). He went on to earn an AQHA Champion title along with a Superior Race Horse award, to go with his AAAT speed index. Mr Meyers became a successful breeding stallion. Miss Meyers' fourth foal was a 1959 chestnut mare named Milpool sired by Vandy. Milpool was never raced or entered in a horse show.\nMiss Meyers died in March 1963, shortly after having Kid Meyers.

From 1896 through 1913, Seymour played for the New York Giants (1896 – 1900, 1906 – 1910), Baltimore Orioles (1901 – 1902), Cincinnati Reds (1902 – 1906) and Boston Braves (1913). He batted and threw left-handed.\nPrimarily a center fielder, Seymour retired with 1,724 hits and a lifetime batting average of .303. He was a pitcher for his first five seasons, ending his MLB career with a 61 – 56 win – loss record and a 3.76 earned run average in 140 games pitched (123 as a starting pitcher). Only Babe Ruth retired with more combined wins and hits. Seymour is the Reds' career leader in batting average (.332) and holds the Reds' single-season record for batting average (.377 in 1905).\n= = Career = =\n= = = Early career = = =\nSeymour played semi-professional baseball in Plattsburgh, New York, receiving a monthly salary of $1,000 ($28,444 in current dollar terms). He began his professional career in minor league baseball with Springfield Ponies of the Class-A Eastern League and New York Metropolitans of the Class-A Atlantic League in 1896.\n= = = Major League Baseball = = =\n= = = = New York Giants (1896 – 1900) = = = =\nSeymour signed with the New York Giants of the National League (NL) during the 1896 season, making his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on April 22. A sometimes wild pitcher, The New York Times described him as having a \"$10,000 arm and a $00,000 head\". Seymour set a MLB record with three errors in one inning, a record later tied by Tommy John. However, he pitched to an 18 – 14 win – loss record in 1897, with a 3.37 earned run average (ERA), while recording 149 strikeouts, good for second in the NL.\nIn 1898, he won 25 games, had a 3.18 ERA, and led the NL in strikeouts with 239, while leading the team in wins and games started (43). During the season, Seymour pitched three games in two days against the Baltimore Orioles. Orioles manager John McGraw later said that Seymour deserved the title of \"Iron Man\" more than Joe McGinnity.\nSeymour held out from the Giants for the first month of the 1899 season in a contract dispute, eventually signing for $2,000 ($56,888 in current dollar terms), a $500 raise ($14,222 in current dollar terms) over his 1898 salary. He finished second in the NL in strikeouts with 142. Seymour was briefly demoted to the minor leagues after walking 11 batters in a victory against the St. Louis Perfectos on June 7, 1900. Due to injuries and the ineffectiveness of the Giants' outfielders, the team began to play Seymour in the outfield, though they insisted that Seymour would not shift positions on a permanent basis. Seymour last pitched for the Giants that season, at which point he converted into an outfielder full-time due to injury from throwing the screwball.\n= = = = Baltimore Orioles (1901 – 1902) = = = =\nWith the formation of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, Seymour joined many fellow NL players who jumped to the AL. McGraw, remembering Seymour's toughness in previous seasons, signed Seymour to his team, the Baltimore Orioles, before the 1901 season. Seymour batted .303 with the Orioles that year. By 1902, the franchise began to fall into significant debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($328,200 in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and player-manager McGraw, who had resigned from the team and signed with the Giants. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released Seymour, McGraw, Kelley, McGinnity, Roger Bresnahan, Jack Cronin, and Dan McGann from their Oriole contracts. Brush then signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new player-manager, on the Giants.\n= = = = Cincinnati Reds (1902 – 1906) = = = =\nReds owner Garry Herrmann added $100 per month ($2,735 in current dollar terms) to Seymour's $2,800 annual salary ($76,580 in current dollar terms) when he acquired him from Baltimore, and made him the team's starting center fielder. He set a record with four sacrifice bunts in one game on July 25, 1902; this mark was tied by Jake Daubert on August 15, 1914. Seymour continued to bat above .300 with the Reds in each season through 1905, when he led the NL in batting average (.377), hits (219), runs batted in (RBI) (121), doubles (40), triples (21), and slugging percentage (.559). He would have won the Triple Crown but he finished second in home runs with eight, behind Fred Odwell's nine. His .377 batting average set the single-season record for the Reds, and his 325 total bases that season were an NL record through 1919. Seymour had a .333 batting average during his tenure with the Reds, which remains a franchise record.\n= = = = New York Giants (1906 – 1910) = = = =\nThe Giants purchased Seymour from the Reds on July 12, 1906 for $10,000 ($263,370 in current dollar terms), the largest monetary transaction in baseball to date. Seymour attempted to hold out from the Giants in order to obtain a portion of this transfer fee, claiming that Herrmann had promised him this money if the sale was completed. McGraw convinced Seymour not to hold out, which could have set a precedent for players obtaining money in player transactions. He batted .286 in 1906 for the Reds and Giants, finishing eighth in the NL.\nSeymour finished fifth in the NL in batting average (.294) for the 1907 season. However, an ankle injury prematurely ended his season. His batting average declined to .267 for the 1908 season. That year, he participated in one of baseball's most infamous plays, known as Merkle's Boner, in which the Giants lost the pennant to the Chicago Cubs. In the replayed game between the Giants and Cubs, Giants pitcher Christy Mathewson reportedly waved Seymour to move further back in the outfield; Seymour refused, only to see the ball hit over his head, allowing the Cubs to score three runs on their way to the win. Mathewson later denied waving Seymour back, saying Seymour \"knew the Chicago batters as well as [he] did and how to play them.\"\nAs there were no full-time base coaches at the time, players took turns in the role. While coaching at third base, Seymour tackled teammate Moose McCormick as he rounded third base and headed for home plate, in an attempt to keep McCormick at third. McCormick overpowered Seymour and scored. When McGraw asked why, Seymour made an excuse about having the sun in his eyes. This led McGraw, now realizing the need for a full-time coach, to hire Arlie Latham for the role, the first full-time coach in MLB. Seymour got into an altercation with Latham in March 1909 at the team's hotel, prompting McGraw to seek a buyer for Seymour. Seymour apologized to McGraw, who responded by suspending Seymour for eight weeks. However, Seymour injured his right leg in his first game back from the suspension. This injury limited his effectiveness for the rest of his career. As a part-time player that season, he batted .311, best among NL reserves. He again played a reserve role for the Giants in 1910, batting .265 in 79 games.\n= = = Later career = = =\nThe minor league Baltimore Orioles of the Class-A Eastern League purchased Seymour from the Giants on August 24, 1910. After playing for the Orioles in the 1911 season, they sold him to the Newark Indians of the Class-AA International League, where he played during the 1912 season. Seymour became property of the Los Angeles Angels of the Class-A Pacific Coast League after the 1912 season, but he secured his release from the Angels without playing a game for them,\nSeymour subsequently signed as a free agent with the Boston Braves on February 25, 1913. After playing sparingly for the Braves during the 1913 season, the Braves released him on July 19, 1913, as they were carrying 26 players on their roster, though league rules permitted a maximum roster of 25. Seymour played for the Buffalo Bisons of the Class-A International League after being released by the Braves. He returned to professional baseball in 1918, playing in 13 games for the Newark Bears of the International League.\n= = After baseball = =\nSeymour was declared physically unfit for service in World War I. However, he worked in wartime jobs in the Speedway shipyards and Bush terminal. While working in the shipyards, he contracted tuberculosis, and died at his home on September 20, 1919. He was interred in Albany Rural Cemetery.\n= = Career perspective = =\nFew players enjoyed as much success as Seymour as both a pitcher and hitter; only Babe Ruth recorded more combined pitching victories and hits. As a pitcher, Seymour threw a fastball, a curveball, and a screwball. Orioles catcher Wilbert Robinson said that he had never caught a pitcher as wild as Seymour, as opposing batters did \"not know whether their head or feet were in most danger.\"\nIn his 16-year MLB career, Seymour hit 52 home runs with 799 RBI, 1,723 hits, 222 stolen bases, and a .303 batting average. He also won 61 games as a pitcher. Seymour was posthumously inducted in the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1998.\nThe New York World listed Seymour as one of the best players in baseball, along with Mathewson, Ed Walsh, Honus Wagner, Nap Lajoie, and Roger Bresnahan. Elmer Flick insisted that Seymour was the toughest pitcher he batted against, saying he \"was practically unhittable\" and that Seymour \"had a wonderful control of his curve ball.\"\nAccording to a formula for evaluating baseball players developed by Bill James, Seymour ranks above Hall of Famers Lloyd Waner, Jimmy Collins, and Joe Tinker."

Her dam (mother) was out of a mare named Big Bay, who was of unknown breeding. Jimmie Allred was sired by Dan whose father was Old Joe Bailey. Jimmie Allred's dam was Alice McGill who was sired by Little Hickory Bill, a son of Hickory Bill who was sired by Peter McCue Garrett's Miss Pawhuska was bred by Bill Rowe of Carlsbad, New Mexico, but by the time she was a yearling she was owned by Earl Jackson, of Pawhuska, Oklahoma. It isn't clear if Jackson bought Garrett's Miss Pawhuska as a foal or if he bought Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's dam while she was still carrying Garrett's Miss Pawhuska.\nWhen Garrett's Miss Pawhuska was a yearling, Dee Garrett visited Jackson's ranch and one of Jackson's ranch hands told him the filly was for sale for $200 (approximately $2,100 in current dollars). Although Jackson had not planned to sell the filly, he felt obligated to complete the sale because his employee had put a price on her.\n= = Race career = =\nAlthough Garrett's widow later described Garrett's Miss Pawhuska as \"scrawny — she looked like a jackrabbit then\", Garrett trained her for the track and she raced as a two-year-old and three-year-old. Her first race was the Oklahoma Futurity in 1948, where she won her qualifying heat and won the finals by a nose. The finals' start was delayed, but even after the delay, Garrett's Miss Pawhuska won, beating Savannah G, Lapped, and Red River Pride. Her time for the 220 yards (200 m) race was 12.7 seconds.\nAlthough Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's official record with the American Quarter Horse Association (or AQHA) is six starts and six wins, the early records are not all entered into the AQHA's computers and the official charts published in the 1940s show she lost a match race to Gin High. However, the published race chart for the race noted that she was leading the race until she ran over a stake 50 yards (46 m) before the end of the race, which caused her to lose the race. She earned a Race ROM and $250.00 (approximately $2,500 in current dollars) in her official records. The official earnings only reflect one race, a match race in 1949, but they don't list the other purses she earned, including the $1,000 (approximately $9,800 in current dollars) purse for the 1948 Oklahoma Futurity. She also is claimed to have won a match race worth $2,500 (approximately $24,900 in current dollars), although this was an unofficial race.\nGarrett's Miss Pawhuska's jockey at the time, C. W. Cascio, said of her when he raced her at Del Rio, Texas, \"I thought she was going to have to go all out just to keep up with those big two-year-olds — what with her little enough to run under their bellies.\" Her last race was at Enid, Oklahoma, and it was a match race against Bob K K, which she won.\n= = Breeding career = =\nGarrett's Miss Pawhuska's owner, Dee Garrett, bred her to his champion stallion Vandy, and produced three world champions: Vandy's Flash, Vanetta Dee, and Vannevar. Vansarita Too set a new track record and Vandy's Betty and Miss Vanity earned AAA speed ratings. Her first foal was Vandy's Betty, who went on to earn an AAA rating on the race track and became the dam of Mr. Van Deck. Her next foal was Vanetta Dee, who racked up 94 starts with 31 wins, 20 seconds and 16 thirds in six years of racing. Her total earnings were $83,325 (approximately $676,400 in current dollars). Vannevar was the next foal, and was AQHA Champion Racing Gelding in 1956 and 1957. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1954 foal was Vandy's Flash, who was the first gelding named World Champion Quarter Running Horse, in 1960. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1955 foal was Vansarita, who was never raced. A number of miscarriages followed, but in 1958 Garrett's Miss Pawhuska produced Miss Vanity, another AAA-rated racehorse. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska slipped, or lost, her next two foals, but produced Vansarita Too in 1961, who also earned an AAA on the race track. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal by Vandy was Vandy's Flash, a stallion, who was never raced but sired 107 foals. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal was not by Vandy, but was by a son of Three Bars named The Ole Man, but the gelding was never raced.\n= = Death and legacy = =\nGarrett's Miss Pawhuska died at the age of 29 in 1975. She was buried on the Garretts' ranch outside Pawhuska. Garrett's grandson said of her that \"She was very gentle, the kind of mare you could do anything with.\" He also said of her \"I guess you could say she was a family pet. I used to rider her out to the pastures to round up other mares, things like that.\" She was on the leading dams of Race ROM earners from 1959 through 1969.\nGarrett's Miss Pawhuska was inducted into the AQHA's AQHA Hall of Fame. in 2006. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska also has a stakes race named in her honor at Remington Park Track in Oklahoma City.\n= = Pedigree = ="

                "text": "= Jim Bottomley =\nJames Leroy Bottomley (April 23, 1900 – December 11, 1959) was an American professional baseball player. A first baseman, Bottomley played in Major League Baseball from 1922 through 1937 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, and St. Louis Browns. He also served as player-manager for the Browns in 1937. Playing for the Cardinals against Brooklyn at Ebbets Field on September 16, 1924, he set the all-time single game RBI record with 12.\nBorn in Oglesby, Illinois, Bottomley grew up in Nokomis, Illinois. He dropped out of high school at the age of 16 to raise money for his family. After playing semi-professional baseball, the Cardinals scouted and signed Bottomley. He won the League Award, given to the most valuable player, in 1928, and was a part of World Series championship teams in 1926 and 1931. He played for the Cardinals through the 1932 season, after which he was traded to the Reds. After playing for Cincinnati for three years, he played two more seasons with the Browns.\nAfter finishing his playing career with the Browns, Bottomley joined the Chicago Cubs organization as a scout and minor league baseball manager. After suffering a heart attack, Bottomley and his wife retired to raise cattle in Missouri. Bottomley was nicknamed \"Sunny Jim\" because of his cheerful disposition. Bottomley was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 by the Veterans Committee and to the Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014.\n= = Early life = =\nBottomley was born on April 23, 1900, to Elizabeth (née Carter) and John Bottomley in Oglesby, Illinois. His family later moved to Nokomis, Illinois, where Bottomley enrolled in grade school and Nokomis High School. He dropped out when he was 16 years old in order to help support his family financially. Bottomley worked as a coal miner, truck driver, grocery clerk, and railroad clerk. His younger brother, Ralph, died in a mining accident in 1920.\nBottomley also played semi-professional baseball for several local teams to make additional money, earning $5 a game ($79 in current dollar terms). A police officer who knew Branch Rickey, the general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, saw Bottomley play, and recommended Bottomley to Rickey.\n= = Professional career = =\n= = = St. Louis Cardinals = = =\nRickey dispatched scout Charley Barrett to investigate Bottomley. The Cardinals decided to invite Bottomley to a tryout in late 1919, and signed him to a $150-a-month ($2,047 in current dollar terms) contract. Bottomley began his professional career in minor league baseball in 1920. That year, Bottomley played for the Mitchell Kernels of the Class-D South Dakota League, posting a .312 batting average in 97 games, as Barrett continued to scout him. He also played six games for the Sioux City Packers of the Class-A Western League. During his time in the minor leagues, the media began to call Bottomley \"Sunny Jim\", due to his pleasant disposition.\nThe next season, Bottomley played for the Houston Buffaloes of the Class-A Texas League. Bottomley suffered a leg injury early in the season which became infected, and impeded his performance during the season. Bottomley managed only a .227 batting average in 130 games and struggled with his fielding. Unable to sell Bottomley to Houston for $1,200 after the season ($15,920 in current dollar terms), Rickey sold Bottomley to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class-AA International League for $1,000 ($13,267 in current dollar terms). Fully recovered from his leg injury in 1922, Bottomley batted .348 with 14 home runs, 15 triples, and a .567 slugging percentage for the Chiefs. After the season, the Cardinals purchased Bottomley from the Chiefs for $15,000 ($212,058 in current dollar terms).\nBottomley made his Major League Baseball debut for the St. Louis Cardinals on August 18, 1922. Replacing Jack Fournier, Bottomley batted .325 in 37 games. The Cardinals named Bottomley their starting first baseman in 1923. As a rookie, Bottomley batted .371, finishing second in the National League (NL) behind teammate Rogers Hornsby, who batted .384. His .425 on-base percentage also finished second in the NL behind Hornsby, while he finished sixth in slugging percentage, with a .535 mark. His 94 runs batted in (RBIs) were tenth-best in the league.\nBottomley posted a .316 batting average in 1924. In a game against the Brooklyn Dodgers on September 16, 1924, Bottomley set the major league record for RBIs in a single game, with 12, breaking Wilbert Robinson's record of 11, set in 1892. Robinson was serving as the manager of the Dodgers at the time. This mark has since been tied by Mark Whiten in 1993. Finishing the season with 111 RBIs, placing third in the NL, Bottomley's 14 home runs were seventh-best in the NL, while his .500 slugging percentage was good for tenth.\nBottomley hit .367 in 1925, finishing second in the NL to Hornsby. He led the NL with 227 hits, while his 128 RBIs were third-best, and his .413 on-base percentage was seventh-best in the league. Bottomley batted .298 during the 1926 season, with an NL-leading 120 RBIs. His 19 home runs placed second in the NL, behind Hack Wilson's 21, while his .506 slugging percentage was sixth-best. He batted .345 in the 1926 World Series, as the Cardinals defeated the New York Yankees.\nIn 1927, Bottomley finished the season with 124 RBIs, fourth best in the league, and a .509 slugging percentage, finishing sixth in the NL. Bottomley hit .325 with 31 home runs and 136 RBIs in 1928, leading the league in home runs and RBIs. He also became the second Major League player in history to join the 20 – 20 – 20 club. That year, he won the League Award, given to the most valuable player of the NL. The Cardinals reached the 1928 World Series, and Bottomley batted .214 as they lost to the New York Yankees.\nIn 1929, Bottomley hit 29 home runs, finishing seventh in the NL, while his 137 RBIs were fifth-best, and his .568 slugging percentage placed him in eighth. After having what manager Gabby Street considered a \"poor year\" in 1930, Bottomley struggled in the 1930 World Series, batting .045 in 22 at-bats, as the Cardinals lost to the Philadelphia Athletics. Following the series, Bottomley described his World Series performance as \"a bust as far as hitting goes\".\nAmid questions about Bottomley's status with the Cardinals heading into the 1931 season, he demonstrated renewed hitting ability during spring training. Despite the presence of Ripper Collins, a superior fielder who transferred to the Cardinals from the Rochester Red Wings of the International League, Street announced that Bottomley would remain the starting first baseman. However, Bottomley suffered an injury and struggled early in the 1931 season after returning to the game, and it appeared that he might lose his job to Collins, who filled in for Bottomley during his injury. Bottomley returned to form after his return, and he finished the season with a .3482 batting average, placing third behind teammate Chick Hafey's .3489 and Bill Terry's .3486, the closest batting average finish in MLB history. His .534 slugging percentage was the sixth best in the league. The Cardinals reached the 1931 World Series, with Bottomley batting .160, as the Cardinals defeated the Athletics. That offseason, other teams began to attempt to trade for either Bottomley or Collins. Bottomley batted .296 in 1932, though he only played in 91 games.\n= = = Cincinnati Reds = = =\nAfter the 1932 season, the Cardinals traded Bottomley to the Cincinnati Reds for Ownie Carroll and Estel Crabtree, in an attempt to partner Bottomley with Chick Hafey in developing a more potent offensive attack. Bottomley had also sought Cincinnati's managerial position that offseason, which instead went to Donie Bush.\nBottomley threatened to quit baseball in a salary dispute with the Reds, as he attempted to negotiate a raise from his $8,000 salary ($146,242 in current dollar terms), a reduction from the $13,000 salary ($225,471 in current dollar terms) he earned with the Cardinals the previous year. He and the Reds eventually came to terms on a one-year contract believed to be worth between $10,000 and $13,000. Bottomley finished eighth in the NL with 83 RBIs in 1933, and ninth with 13 home runs. In three seasons with the Reds, Bottomley failed to hit higher than .283 or record more than 83 RBIs in a season. Bottomley left the Reds during spring training in 1935 due to a salary dispute, deciding to return to the team in April.\n= = = St. Louis Browns = = =\nBefore the 1936 season, the Reds traded Bottomley to the St. Louis Browns of the American League (AL), who were managed by Hornsby, for Johnny Burnett. During a July road trip, Bottomley announced his retirement as a result of an injured back; however, he changed his mind and decided to remain with the team. Bottomley batted .298 for the 1936 season.\nBottomley decided to return to baseball in 1937. When the Browns struggled during the 1937 season, beginning the season with a 25 – 52 win-loss record, the Browns fired Hornsby and named Bottomley their player-manager. Bottomley led the Browns to 21 more victories, as the team finished the season in eighth place, with a 46 – 108 record. The Browns trailed the seventh place Athletics by 9 1 ⁄ 2 games, and were 56 games out of first place. As a player, Bottomley batted .239 in 65 games during the 1937 season. Bottomley was among the ten oldest players in the AL that year.\nThe Browns did not retain Bottomley after the 1937 season, replacing him with Street, who served as his first assistant during the 1937 season. In 1938, Bottomley served as the player-manager of Syracuse. After a bad start to the season, and with team president Jack Corbett not adding capable players, Bottomley resigned and was replaced with Dick Porter. Bottomley also indicated that he did not want to continue playing.\nBottomley also holds the single-season record for most unassisted double plays by a first baseman, with eight. Bottomley is also known as the only man to be sued for hitting a home run when a fan was hit by the ball when he was not looking. He had over 100 RBIs in each season from 1924 to 1929. Bottomley was the second player in baseball history to hit 20 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in one season (Frank Schulte being the first) and the first of two players (Lou Gehrig being the other) to collect 150 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in a career.\n= = Personal = =\nBottomley married Elizabeth \"Betty\" Browner, who operated a St. Louis beauty parlor, on February 4, 1933. The couple had no children. After he retired from baseball in 1938, Bottomley and his wife moved to the Bourbon, Missouri, area, where he raised Hereford cattle. In 1939, Bottomley became a radio broadcaster, signing a deal with KWK, an AM broadcasting station, to broadcast Cardinals and Browns games.\nBottomley returned to baseball as a scout for the Cardinals in 1955. In 1957, he joined the Chicago Cubs as a scout and managed the Pulaski Cubs of the Class D Appalachian League. While managing in Pulaski, Bottomley suffered a heart attack. The Bottomleys moved to nearby Sullivan, Missouri. Bottomley died of a heart ailment in December 1959. He and his wife Betty were interred in the International Order of Fellows Cemetery, Sullivan, Missouri.\n= = Honors = =\nBottomley was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame posthumously in 1974 by the Veterans Committee. The Baseball Writers' Association of America charged that the Veterans Committee was not selective enough in choosing members. Charges of cronyism were levied against the Veterans Committee. When Bottomley was elected, the Veterans Committee included Frankie Frisch, a teammate of Bottomley's with the Cardinals. Frisch and Bill Terry, also a member of the Veterans Committee at the time, shepherded the selections of teammates Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross Youngs in 1972, George Kelly in 1973, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976. This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years. In 2014, the Cardinals announced Bottomley among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.\nThe city park in Sullivan is named for Bottomley. A museum in Nokomis, Illinois, the Bottomley-Ruffing-Schalk Baseball Museum, is dedicated to Bottomley and fellow Hall of Famers Ray Schalk and Red Ruffing, who were also Nokomis natives."

It is the episode known for spawning the eight-month \"Who shot J.R.?\" hysteria. The episode ended with the mysterious shooting of J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) in his office by an assailant that would not be revealed until the following season. The episode served as both an introduction to the now common practice of season-ending cliffhangers and the beginning of an eight-month international media frenzy. The mystery was resolved in the fourth episode of the following season, entitled \"Who Done It\", which continues to be the second most-watched episode in TV history.\nIn the episode, nationalization of the Asian fields causes financial ruin that affects the cartel members and J.R. Ewing's banker. This leads to the suicide of cartel member Seth Stone (Buck Young). J.R. attempts to run both Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby) and Alan Beam (Randolph Powell) out of town as they both plot revenge against him. He also attempts to move Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray) back into a sanitarium. With Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) having sought revenge upon J.R. based on an agreement he realized Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Digger Barnes (Keenan Wynn) had, J.R. has the oil fields stopped to keep Cliff from earning any royalties. Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal) and husband Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) move out of Southfork out of disgust at J.R. 's dealings. In the end, J.R. is shot while working late at the office.\n= = Plot = =\n= = = Background = = =\nJ.R. Ewing is a fictional character that William K. Stevens of The New York Times described as \"the nastiest man on television, the Iago of Texas oilmen, the smiling snake of a star of Friday night TV's Dallas, a man so venal, so low, so mean, so diabolical that he has become an absolute delight to an estimated quarter of a billion viewers around the globe.\" His New York Times colleague John J. O'Connor described him as \"the eldest son of the oil-rich Ewing family...\" who is \"... a sadistic bully and a swindler\" that \"captured the public's imagination\". Season 3 left the viewer with numerous people to suspect for the murder.\nSue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray) is J.R. 's wife. J.R. had threatened to reinstitutionalize her for alcoholism. Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby) is J.R.' s ex-mistress and Sue Ellen's sister. J.R. broke his promise to marry her and gave her 24 hours to leave town. J.R. framed her for prostitution in response to business pressure she put on him. Dusty Farlow (Jared Martin) is Sue Ellen's lover. He was supposedly killed in a plane crash. Vaughn Leland (Dennis Patrick) is J.R. 's business partner. J.R. swindled him out of $20 million (US $57 million in 2016 dollars). Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes) is J.R.' s mother. J.R. mortgaged the family ranch, unbeknownst to his parents, and had plans to drill for oil on the property. Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) is Bobby's brother-in-law and business rival. His father (Digger Barnes) was swindled by J.R. 's father (Jock Ewing), leaving him penniless except for some oil wells that J.R. had shut down. Alan Beam (Randolph Powell) is a political fixer. Beam knew too much about J.R.' s dirty dealings, making him expendable after J.R. tried to extinguish him, giving him motive. Marilee Stone (Fern Fitzgerald) is the widow of a business associate. Her husband committed suicide as a result of business dealings with J.R. Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) is J.R. 's mild-mannered brother. He is the classic sibling rival, who is fed up with J.R.' s handling of family business and slights to Bobby's wife, Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), who happens to be Cliff's sister.\nAlthough generally regarded as somewhat of a rival of J.R. in the fictional world of Dallas, Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford) was not a suspect due to his activity in the related fictional Knots Landing world. Similarly, Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) had an alibi provided by liaisons with a married college professor.\n= = = Day 1 = = =\nJ.R. explains to Jock and Bobby that Ewing Oil is doing fine, leaving Bobby suspicious. J.R. had swindled most of the other oilmen that he knows to salvage Ewing Oil by convincing their cartel to buy worthless oil fields from him just prior to nationalization. Cartel member, Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide as a result of the dealings. Soon thereafter, Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization. The report ends with the story of the widowed Marilee Stone, whose husband Seth had bought shares from Ewing Oil. Marilee's calls to J.R. are refused. Cartel member Vaughn Leland, who lost $20 million (US $57 million in 2016 dollars) in the deal, reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him, but Jock refuses to offer any restitution. All of the cartel members have lost everything they had in the deal and J.R. increased his wealth in the dealings. The Ewings question whether J.R. took advantage of inside information. J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him. Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor / boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason. Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone. Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information. Shepard has been tape recording secrets of the cartel members from between the sheets and learned how J.R. got them all to buy his oil wells. Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R. 's secretary. Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother, Rebecca. They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger. Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re-institutionalize her. Bobby says he will try to keep J.R. from taking that action. J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard's request for records and to shred them. Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Elby. She gets a reminder about drinking until you are unconscious and promises to stop. J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief. He tries to bribe her to leave, but she does not accept the offer. J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen. She alerts him that Bobby is going to speak up for her. He is not worried. She then inquires about whether he is going to be unfaithful. When he leaves for another woman she gets upset, but finds a gun lying around, which gives her pause.\n= = = Day 2 = = =\nCliff arrives at Ewing Oil with paperwork proving his (and his sister Pam's) claim to a share of Ewing 23 oil well, one of Ewing Oil's most profitable wells. J.R. confirms it is producing 5,000 barrels / month which would give Cliff $500,000 / year (US $1.436 million / year in 2016 dollars). J.R. shuts down that oil well rather than let Cliff earn a dime from it. Bobby expresses his concern to his wife about her obsession that has caused her to quit her fashion buyer job to search for her mother. Lucy spends quality time with her professor. After she leaves he calls his wife. Police officer Harry McSween brings Beam to J.R. 's office to clarify that J.R. wants him to leave town. J.R. demonstrates how he could use his influence to trump up rape charges. J.R. tells Bobby and Jock that he shut down the wells to shut off new claimant Barnes. Bobby is upset, but Jock agrees. Pam and Bobby decide to leave Southfork in disgust.\n= = = Day 3 = = =\nBobby and Pam depart in the morning after Bobby informs Miss Ellie and Jock. The parents are displeased. Sue Ellen and J.R. enter at the end of the debate with the parents in time to remind J.R. that he has driven them away. This pleases J.R. and he reminds her that his is going to put her away for speaking ill of him. McSween serves Shepard with a warrant for her arrest on charges of prostitution in front of Beam who was visiting her. He offers them a deal. If they leave town within 24 hours, he won't chase them. She threatens to kill J.R. J.R. calls Dr. Rogers to take Sue Ellen away that night. J.R. hangs up on Leland who is continuing to threaten him. Sue Ellen continues to ponder the gun and tucks it in her purse before heading out somewhere. Cliff visits Digger Barnes' grave. He apologizes to his dad that he let J.R. beat him like Jock had beaten the father. J.R. is at the office at night when Rogers arrives at Southfork to cart Sue Ellen away.

Executive producer Philip Capice says they decided to attempt to work in a ploy to hold interest over the summer. CBS ordered two extra episodes, which gave them a chance to weave many storylines into the scripts. He noted that \"J.R. had developed into a character we felt everyone out there wanted to see get his comeuppance. And we did need that sort of a cliffhanger to carry us over to the new season.\" He said that there was consensus that a mystery with several suspects was optimal and that it should be a sudden event. Capice denied rumors that the shooting was a ploy to make it easy to write Hagman out of the script if his contract negotiations became too difficult. Producer Leonard Katzman, executive story consultant Art Lewis and story editor Camille Marchetta decided the actual culprit in mid-March by process of logical elimination with the belief that the audience should not be surprised by someone who was not important to the show as the shooter.\n= = Reception = =\n\"A House Divided\" served as both an introduction to the now common practice of season-ending cliffhangers and the beginning of an eight-month international media frenzy. International oddsmakers created a set of odds for the possible suspects: \"Dusty Farlow (J. R. 's wife Sue Ellen's lover, who disappeared after a plane crash) is the 6 to 4 favorite, followed by Vaughn Leland (a banker J. R. swindled) and Kristin Shepard (J. R.' s mistress) at 4 to 1. Sue Ellen herself is a long shot at 25 to 1, as is J.R. 's long- suffering mom, Miss Ellie.\" After Sue Ellen's fingerprints were found on the gun in subsequent episodes she became the favorite at 3 to 1 according to some oddsmakers, while others listed Shepard and Cliff Barnes as favorites. Even Jimmy The Greek posted odds of various suspects. Tony Schwartz of The New York Times estimates that viewers in 57 countries saw the episode. The script for the subsequent episode that revealed the killer was stolen from Lorimar Productions. The Los Angeles Herald Examiner claimed to have received a copy from a \"news source\". Eventually they returned it to Los Angeles Police Department Chief Daryl Gates. Discussion about the mystery took place in a variety of media forms including Time.\nThe media publicity was so strong that actor Larry Hagman had a 10-day holdout in which he demanded $100,000 (US $290,000 in 2016 dollars) per episode, while Lorimar Productions offered $55,000 (US $160,000 in 2016 dollars). After 10 days, Hagman agreed to work filming the subsequent season for $75,000 (US $220,000 in 2016 dollars) per episode. Hagman had been working for $25,000 (US $72,000 in 2016 dollars) per episode.\nThe episode earned Fred W. Berger an American Cinema Editors Eddie Award for Best Edited Episode from a Television Series and earned Irving J.

                "text": "= Astonishing Stories =\nAstonishing Stories was an American pulp science fiction magazine, published by Popular Publications between 1940 and 1943. It was founded under Popular's \"Fictioneers\" imprint, which paid lower rates than Popular's other magazines. The magazine's first editor was Frederik Pohl, who also edited a companion publication, Super Science Stories. After nine issues Pohl was replaced by Alden H. Norton, who subsequently rehired Pohl as an assistant. The budget for Astonishing was very low, which made it difficult to acquire good fiction, but through his membership in the Futurians, a group of young science fiction fans and aspiring writers, Pohl was able to find material to fill the early issues. The magazine was successful, and Pohl was able to increase his pay rates slightly within a year. He managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known, such as Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. After Pohl entered the army in early 1943, wartime paper shortages led Popular to cease publication of Astonishing. The final issue was dated April of that year.\nThe magazine was never regarded as one of the leading titles of the genre, but despite the low budget it published some well-received material. Science fiction critic Peter Nicholls comments that \"its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them\", and this view has been echoed by other historians of the field.\n= = Publication history = =\nAlthough science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By the end of the 1930s the field was booming, and several new sf magazines were launched in 1939. Frederik Pohl, a young science fiction reader, was looking for a job that year. He visited Robert Erisman, who was the editor of two pulps, Marvel Science Stories and Dynamic Science Stories, to ask for a job as an assistant. Erisman turned him down, but suggested that Pohl contact Rogers Terrill at Popular Publications, a leading pulp publisher. Erisman had heard that Popular was starting a new line of magazines, and thought that they might be interested in adding a science fiction title. On October 25, 1939, Pohl visited Terrill and persuaded him to give the idea a try, and left Terrill's office having been hired, at the age of nineteen, to edit two new magazines, on a salary of ten dollars per week. One was Super Science Stories; the other was at one point intended to be titled Incredible Stories, but ultimately appeared as Astonishing Stories.\nPopular was uncertain of the sales potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. Astonishing's first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with Super Science Stories. Pohl's budget for an issue was $405: in Pohl's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger, one of the company owners, breaking down the budget for him: \"Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. A hundred dollars for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover.\" Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper than any of the other sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. Pohl later commented that he was uncertain whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. Some of the additional money went to long-time writer Ray Cummings, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came on a day when Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford to pay that rate. Pohl comments in his memoirs that \"for months he would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all.\"\nPohl stretched his budget by reducing the space he needed to fill with fiction. For example, a long letter column took up several pages but required no payment; similarly, running advertisements for Popular's other magazines did not use up the fiction budget. Some authors sent inaccurate word counts with the stories they submitted, and Popular saved money by paying them on the basis of whichever word count was less — the author's or one done by Popular's staff. The result was a saving of forty to fifty dollars per issue. More money was saved by reusing snipped elements of black and white illustrations to fill space, as multiple uses of the same artwork did not require additional payments to the artist.\nTowards the end of 1940 Popular doubled Pohl's salary to twenty dollars per week. In June 1941 Pohl went to see Steeger to ask for a further raise; he was planning to resign and work as a free-lance writer if he did not get more pay. Steeger, in Pohl's words, \"had complaints of his own\", and was not receptive; by the end of the meeting Pohl had lost his job as editor. Pohl later commented \"I have never been sure whether I quit or got fired.\" Instead of replacing Pohl, Popular assigned editor-in-chief Alden H. Norton to add the magazines to his responsibilities. The arrangement lasted for seven months, after which Norton asked Pohl to return as his assistant. Norton offered Pohl a higher salary as an associate editor than he had received as the editor, and Pohl quickly accepted.\nPohl was not eligible to be drafted for military service as he was married, but by the end of 1942 his marriage was over and he decided to enlist. As voluntary enlistment was suspended he was unable to immediately join the army, but eventually was inducted on April 1, 1943. Paper was difficult to obtain because of the war, and Popular decided to close the magazine down; the final issue, dated April 1943, was assembled with the assistance of Ejler Jakobsson.\n= = Contents and reception = =\nBecause of the low rates of pay, the stories submitted to Astonishing in its first year had generally already been rejected elsewhere. However, Pohl was a member of the Futurians, a group of science fiction fans that included Isaac Asimov, C.M. Kornbluth, Richard Wilson and Donald Wollheim; the Futurians were eager to become professional writers and were glad to submit stories to Pohl. Asimov recalls in his memoirs that on October 27, 1939, two days after Pohl was hired to edit the magazines, Pohl turned up at Asimov's apartment and asked to buy \"Half-Breed\", a story Pohl had been trying to sell on Asimov's behalf since June of that year. Pohl needed stories quickly for the first issue of Astonishing (though the name had not yet been selected), and as the story had been rejected by Amazing Stories and Astounding Stories, Asimov was willing to sell it for half a cent per word. A couple of weeks later Pohl also acquired \"The Callistan Menace\" from Asimov. The other Futurians were prolific as well; in Pohl's first year as an editor he bought a total of fifteen stories from them for the two magazines. Damon Knight, another of the Futurians, recalled in his memoirs that Pohl once asked the group for a story to fill out an issue, with $35 available to pay for it. Kornbluth and Wilson wrote a first draft, alternating turns at the typewriter; the result was edited by Harry Dockweiler, another Futurian, and then again by Pohl before it appeared in the April 1940 Astonishing under the title \"Stepsons of Mars\", with a byline of \"Ivar Towers\". Pohl contributed material himself, using the pseudonyms \"James McCreigh\" and \"Dirk Wylie\" (the latter pseudonym was also used by Dockweiler); he used his own stories when he needed to fill an issue, and to supplement his salary of ten dollars a week. Particularly after his marriage to Doris Baumgardt in August 1940, Pohl realized that his salary covered their apartment rent with almost no money left over, and began to augment his income by selling to himself as well as to other magazines. When Pohl lost his job as editor in late 1941, he had bought from himself (and paid for) a couple of stories that he had not actually written, and hence had to write them very quickly and turn them in.\nThe first issue of Astonishing Stories was dated February 1940; the lead story was \"Chameleon Planet\" by John Russell Fearn, and it also included Asimov's \"Half-Breed\" and fiction by Henry Kuttner and Manly Wade Wellman. Despite the difficulties caused by the low budget, Pohl was able to pay his authors promptly, unlike some of his competitors, and he thus began to receive stories of higher quality. Sf historian Mike Ashley identifies \"The Last Drop\", by L. Ron Hubbard and L. Sprague de Camp as one of the better stories in Astonishing; historians Milton Wolf and Raymond H. Thompson consider the story to be unimpressive, and point instead to Alfred Bester's \"The Pet Nebula\" in the February 1941 issue. Kuttner's \"Soldiers of Space\" and Robert Bloch's \"It Happened Tomorrow\", both of which appeared in the February 1943 issue, are also praised. Pohl was also able to print the first three of Ross Rocklynne's well-liked \"Into the Darkness\" series. Other well-known writers who appeared in the pages of Astonishing include Leigh Brackett, Clifford Simak, and E. E. Smith.\nPohl told his readers in Astonishing's first issue that he would listen to their feedback and respond to their requests. In addition to paying attention to their comments on stories, he included departments in the magazine that encouraged interaction with the fans, such as a letter column, a section that listed fanzines with names and addresses, and a review column. The reviews, primarily by Wollheim, but also including contributions from Richard Wilson, Forrest Ackerman, and John Michel, were of a higher standard than elsewhere in the field, and historian Paul Carter regards Astonishing and Super Science Stories as the place where \"book reviewing for the first time began to merit the term 'literary criticism'\", and adds that \"it was in those magazines that the custom began of paying attention to science fiction on the stage and screen also.\"\nThe artwork in Astonishing was initially quite poor, which was unsurprising given the minuscule budget Pohl had to work with. Much of the art was supplied by fans and artists early in their careers, including Doris Baumgardt (under the pseudonym Leslie Perri) and Dorothy Les Tina, who later became Pohl's first and second wives, respectively. One fan artist who stood out from the rest was Hannes Bok, who went on to become a well-respected artist with a very distinctive style. Ray Bradbury commented positively on Bok's work in a letter in the August 1940 Astonishing, and Bok subsequently illustrated a story of Bradbury's in the April 1943 issue. Aleck Portegal, Popular's art director, had initially told Pohl that the regular artists would be unwilling to work for the low rates he could offer, but in the event some of them were willing to take less pay to get the extra work. More professional art began to appear in the magazine, including work by Virgil Finlay, Alexander Leydenfrost, Leo Morey, Hans Wessolowski, and Frank R. Paul, all well known in the field. Some art appeared under the name Stephen Lawrence, which was known to be a pseudonym of Lawrence Stevens, but it was subsequently discovered that some of this work was actually by Lawrence Stevens' son Peter.\nAstonishing Stories is not remembered as being among the best science fiction magazines: both critic Peter Nicholls and sf writer Jack Williamson have described it as a \"training ground\" for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. However, Nicholls adds that \"its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them\", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that \"there was much that was memorable in Astonishing, both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality\". Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. He quotes as an example his serialization of Malcolm Jameson's story \"Quicksands of Youthwardness\" in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to read the whole story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying \"I wasn't really a very good editor\"; adding \"With what I know now I could have made those magazines sing, but as it was they just lay there\".\n= = Bibliographic details = =\nAstonishing Stories was edited by Frederik Pohl from February 1940 through September 1941 (nine issues), and then by Alden H. Norton from November 1941 through April 1943 (seven issues). It was published by Fictioneers, Inc., a subsidiary of Popular Publications. It was pulp-sized throughout its run, with 112 pages and a cover price of 10 cents. The volume numbering was regular, with four volumes of four numbers. It was bimonthly for the first eight issues; the next four were on an irregular schedule, and the last four, from October 1942, were bimonthly again.\nA Canadian edition appeared for three issues, dated January, March, and May 1942, published by Popular Publications' Toronto branch. It was priced at 10 cents and ran to 96 pages; it was also in pulp format, but fractionally larger than the US version. The first and third issues reprinted the November 1941 and March 1942 US issues of Astonishing, but the March 1942 Canadian issue was a reprint of the November 1941 Super Science Stories, omitting one story. The covers in all three issues were replaced by new paintings, and the interior artwork was also different. The artists responsible for the new illustrations and covers were not credited. In August 1942 a Canadian edition of Super Science Stories began which also alternated between reprinting the US editions of Astonishing and Super Science Stories; this could be regarded as a continuation of the Canadian edition of Astonishing, although the volume numbering was restarted at volume 1 number 1 when the name was changed."

Popular launched it under their \"Fictioneers\" imprint, which they used for magazines paying writers less than one cent per word. Frederik Pohl was hired in late 1939, at 19 years old, to edit the magazine; he also edited Astonishing Stories, a companion science fiction publication. Pohl left in mid-1941, and Super Science Stories was given to Alden H. Norton to edit; a few months later Norton rehired Pohl as an assistant. Popular gave Pohl a very low budget, so most manuscripts submitted to Super Science Stories had already been rejected by the higher-paying magazines. This made it difficult to acquire good fiction, but Pohl was able to acquire stories for the early issues from the Futurians, a group of young science fiction fans and aspiring writers.\nSuper Science Stories was an initial success, and within a year Popular increased Pohl's budget slightly, allowing him to pay a bonus rate on occasion. Pohl wrote many stories himself, to fill the magazine and to augment his salary. He managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known, such as Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. After Pohl entered the army in early 1943, wartime paper shortages led Popular to cease publication of Super Science Stories. The final issue of the first run was dated May of that year. In 1949 the title was revived with Ejler Jakobsson as editor; this version, which included many reprinted stories, lasted almost three years, with the last issue dated August 1951. A Canadian reprint edition of the first run included material from both Super Science Stories and Astonishing Stories; it was unusual in that it printed some original fiction rather than just reprints. There were also Canadian and British reprint editions of the second incarnation of the magazine.\nThe magazine was never regarded as one of the leading titles of the genre, but has received qualified praise from science fiction critics and historians. Science fiction historian Raymond Thompson describes it as \"one of the most interesting magazines to appear during the 1940s\", despite the variable quality of the stories. Critics Brian Stableford and Peter Nicholls comment that the magazine \"had a greater importance to the history of sf than the quality of its stories would suggest; it was an important training ground\".\n= = Publication history = =\nAlthough science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback.

Erisman did not have an opening for him, but told Pohl that Popular Publications, a leading pulp publisher, was starting a new line of low-paying magazines and might be interested in adding a science fiction title. On October 25, 1939, Pohl visited Rogers Terrill at Popular, and was hired immediately, at the age of nineteen, on a salary of ten dollars per week. Pohl was given two magazines to edit: Super Science Stories and Astonishing Stories. Super Science Stories was intended to carry longer pieces, and Astonishing focused on shorter fiction; Super Science Stories was retitled Super Science Novels Magazine in March 1941, reflecting this policy, but after only three issues the title was changed back to Super Science Stories.\nPopular was uncertain of the sales potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. Super Science Stories' first issue was dated March 1940; it was bimonthly, with Astonishing Stories appearing in the alternate months. In Pohl's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger, one of the company owners, breaking down the budget for Astonishing for him: \"Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. A hundred dollars for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover.\" For Super Science Stories, Steeger gave him an additional $50 as it was 16 pages longer, so his total budget was $455 per issue. Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. Super Science Stories sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources: Popular was a major pulp publisher and had a strong distribution network, which helped circulation. Steeger soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. Pohl later commented that he was uncertain whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. Some of the additional money went to Ray Cummings, a long-established sf writer who came to see Pohl in person to submit his work. Cummings refused to sell for less than one cent a word; Pohl had some extra money available when Cummings first visited him, and though he disliked Cummings' work was never able to bring himself to reject Cummings submissions, or even to tell him that he could not really afford to pay the rate Cummings was asking. Pohl comments in his memoirs that \"for months he [Cummings] would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all.\"\nBy reducing the space he needed to fill with fiction Pohl managed to stretch his budget. A long letter column took up several pages but required no payment, and neither did running advertisements for Popular's other magazines.

Norton to add the magazines to his responsibilities. The arrangement lasted for seven months, after which Norton asked Pohl to return as his assistant. Norton offered Pohl thirty-five dollars a week as an associate editor, substantially more than the twenty dollars a week he had received as editor, and Pohl readily accepted.\nPohl was not eligible to be drafted for military service as he was married, but by the end of 1942 his marriage was over and he decided to enlist. As voluntary enlistment was suspended he was unable to immediately join the army, but eventually was inducted on April 1, 1943. Paper was difficult to obtain because of the war, and Popular decided to close the magazine down; the final issue, dated April 1943, was assembled with the assistance of Ejler Jakobsson.\nIn late 1948, as a second boom in science fiction publishing was beginning, Popular decided to revive the magazine. Jakobsson later recalled hearing about the revival while on vacation, swimming in a lake, five miles from a phone: \"A boy on a bicycle showed on shore and shouted, 'Call your office.'\" When he reached a phone, Norton told him that the magazine was being relaunched and would be given to Jakobsson to edit. Damon Knight, who was working for Popular at the time, also worked on the magazine as assistant editor, although he was not credited. The relaunched magazine survived for almost three years, but the market for pulps was weak, and when Knight left in 1950 to edit Worlds Beyond Jakobsson was unable to sustain support for it within Popular. It ceased publication with the August 1951 issue.\n= = Contents and reception = =\nBecause of the low rates of pay, the stories submitted to Super Science Stories in its first year had generally already been rejected elsewhere. However, Pohl was a member of the Futurians, a group of science fiction fans that included Isaac Asimov, C.M.

The Futurians were prolific; in Pohl's first year as an editor he bought a total of fifteen stories from them for the two magazines. Pohl contributed material himself, usually in collaboration with one or more of the Futurians. Particularly after his marriage to Doris Baumgardt in August 1940, Pohl realized that his salary covered their apartment rent with almost no money left over, and began to augment his income by selling to himself as well as to other magazines. The first story Pohl ever published that was not a collaboration was \"The Dweller in the Ice\", which appeared in the January 1941 Super Science Stories. All of the stories Pohl bought from himself were published under pseudonyms, though in fact Pohl used pseudonyms for everything he wrote until the 1950s.\nThe first issue, dated March 1940, contained \"Emergency Refueling\", James Blish's first published story, two stories by John Russell Fearn (one under the pseudonym \"Thornton Ayre\"), fiction by Frank Belknap Long, Ross Rocklynne, Raymond Gallun, Harl Vincent and Dean O'Brien; and a poem by Kornbluth, \"The Song of the Rocket\", under the pseudonym \"Gabriel Barclay\". Blish's most notable contribution to the magazine was \"Sunken Universe\", which appeared in the May 1942 issue under the pseudonym \"Arthur Merlyn\". This later formed part of \"Surface Tension\", one of Blish's most popular stories. Other writers whose first story appeared in Super Science Stories include Ray Bradbury, Chad Oliver, and Wilson Tucker. Bradbury's first sale, \"Pendulum\", was bought by Norton, and appeared in the November 1941 issue; Tucker's writing career began with \"Interstellar Way Station\" in May 1941, and Oliver's \"The Land of Lost Content\" appeared in the November 1950 Super Science Stories. Asimov appeared four times in Super Science Stories, starting with \"Robbie\", his first Robot story, under the title \"Strange Playfellow\".\nAlthough most stories submitted to Super Science Stories were rejects from the better-paying markets such as Astounding Science Fiction, Pohl recalled in his memoirs that John W. Campbell, the editor of Astounding, would occasionally pass on a good story by a prolific author because he felt readers did not want to see the same authors in every issue. As a result, Pohl was able to print L. Sprague de Camp's Genus Homo, in the March 1941 Super Science Stories, and Robert Heinlein's \"Let There Be Light\" and \"Lost Legacy\" in the May 1940 and November 1941 issues: these were stories which, in Pohl's opinion, \"would have looked good anywhere\". Pohl also suggested that Campbell rejected some of Heinlein's stories because they contained mild references to sex. A couple of readers did complain, with one disgusted letter writer commenting \"If you are going to continue to print such pseudosophisticated, pre-prep-school tripe as\" Let There Be Light \", you should change the name of the mag to Naughty Future Funnies\".\nThe second run of Super Science Stories included some fiction that had first appeared in the Canadian reprint edition, which outlasted the U.S. original and printed eleven stories that had been acquired but not printed by the time Popular shut Super Science Stories and Astonishing down in early 1943. These included \"The Black Sun Rises\" by Henry Kuttner, \"And Then – the Silence\", by Ray Bradbury, and \"The Bounding Crown\" by James Blish. From mid-1950 a reprint feature was established. This led to some reader complaints, with one correspondent pointing out that it was particularly galling to discover that Blish's \"Sunken Universe\", reprinted in the November 1950 issue, was a better story than the original material in the magazine. The magazine also reprinted stories from Famous Fantastic Mysteries, which Popular had acquired from Munsey Publishing in 1941.\nSome of the original stories were well-received: for example, Ray Bradbury's \"The Impossible\", which appeared in the November 1949 issue, and was later included in Bradbury's book The Martian Chronicles, is described by sf historian Raymond Thompson as a \"haunting... comment on man's attempts to realize his conflicting hopes and dreams\". Thompson also comments positively on Poul Anderson's early story \"Terminal Quest\", in Super Science Stories's final issue, dated August 1951; and on Arthur C. Clarke's \"Exile of the Eons\" in the March 1950 issue. John D. MacDonald also contributed good material.\nThe book reviews in Super Science Stories were of a higher standard than elsewhere in the field, and historian Paul Carter regards Astonishing and Super Science Stories as the place where \"book reviewing for the first time began to merit the term 'literary criticism'\", adding that \"it was in those magazines that the custom began of paying attention to science fiction on the stage and screen also\". The artwork was initially amateurish, and although it improved over the years, even the better artists such as Virgil Finlay and Lawrence Stevens continued to produce cliched depictions of half-dressed women threatened by robots or aliens. H. R. van Dongen, later a prolific cover artist for Astounding, made his first science fiction art sale to Super Science Stories for the cover of the September 1950 issue.\nSf historian Mike Ashley regards Super Science Stories as marginally better than its companion magazine, Astonishing, adding \"both are a testament to what a good editor can do with a poor budget\". According to sf critics Brian Stableford and Peter Nicholls, the magazine \"had a greater importance to the history of sf than the quality of its stories would suggest; it was an important training ground\".\n= = Bibliographic details = =\nThe first run of Super Science Stories was edited by Frederik Pohl from March 1940 through August 1941 (nine issues), and then by Alden H. Norton from November 1941 through May 1943 (seven issues). Ejler Jakobsson was the editor throughout the second run, from January 1949 to August 1951. The publisher was Popular Publications for both versions, although the first was issued under Popular's Fictioneers imprint. It was pulp-sized throughout both runs. At launch the magazine had 128 pages and was priced at 15 cents; the price increased to 20 cents when it went to 144 pages in March 1941, and again to 25 cents for the May 1943 issue, which had 128 pages again. The second run was priced at 25 cents throughout and had 112 pages. The title was Super Science Stories for both runs except for three issues from March to August 1941, which were titled Super Science Novels Magazine. The volume numbering was completely regular, with seven volumes of four numbers and a final volume of three numbers. It was bimonthly for the first eight issues, from March 1940 to May 1941, and then went to a regular quarterly schedule.\n= = = Canadian and British editions = = =\nIn 1940, as part of the War Exchange Conservation Act, Canada banned the import of pulp magazines. Popular launched a Canadian edition of Astonishing Stories in January 1942, which lasted for three bimonthly issues and reprinted two issues of Astonishing and one issue of Super Science Stories. With the August 1942 issue the name was changed to Super Science Stories, and the numeration was begun again at volume 1 number 1; as a result the magazine is usually listed by bibliographers as a separate publication from the Canadian Astonishing, but in many respects it was a direct continuation. The price was 15 cents throughout; it lasted for 21 regular bimonthly issues in a single volume; the last issue was dated December 1945. It was published by Popular Publications' Toronto branch, and the editor was listed as Alden H. Norton.\nEach issue of the Canadian edition corresponded to one issue of either Astonishing or Super Science: for example, the first two Canadian issues drew their contents from the February 1942 Super Science Stories and the June 1942 Astonishing, respectively. This pattern continued for ten issues. The next issue, dated April 1944, contained several reprints from the US editions, but also included two original stories that had not appeared anywhere before — these had been acquired for the US magazine and remained in inventory. A total of eleven of these original stories appeared in the Canadian Super Science Stories. Later issues of the magazine also saw many reprints from Famous Fantastic Mysteries; in tacit acknowledgement of the new source of material, the title was changed to Super Science and Fantastic Stories from the December 1944 issue. The artwork was mostly taken from Popular's US magazines but some new art appeared, probably by Canadian artists. There was no other Canadian presence: the letters page, for example, contained letters from the US edition.\nIn 1949, when the second run of the US Super Science Stories began, another Canadian edition appeared, but this was identical in content to the US version. Two British reprint editions of the second run also appeared, starting in October 1949. The first was published by Thorpe & Porter; the issues, which were not dated or numbered, appeared in October 1949 and February and June 1950. The contents were drawn from the US issues dated January 1949, November 1949, and January 1950 respectively; each was 96 pages and was priced at 1 / -. The second reprint edition was published by Pemberton's; these were 64 pages and again were undated and were priced at 1 / -.\nThe British issues are abridged versions of US issues from both the first and second series. The titles corresponded to the titles on the US magazine from which the stories were taken, so all were titled Super Science Stories except for the April 1953 issue, which was titled Super Science Novels Magazine."

It is seen as a transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English folk songs that had begun on their previous album, What We Did on Our Holidays and arguably reached its peak on the follow-up, Liege & Lief, released later the same year.\nAlthough featuring several at the time unreleased Bob Dylan songs, the album also marked Sandy Denny's maturation as a singer and songwriter, including \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\", a song covered by many other performers and now regarded as a classic. The only traditional song on the album, \"A Sailor's Life\", is seen as pivotal in the development of English folk rock music.\nChanges in the line-up of the band, due not only to its musical direction but also to external events, mark this album as a turning point in the band's history. 1969 was a prolific year for Fairport Convention; from What We Did on Our Holidays to Liege & Lief within twelve months represented a major development.\nThe album also gave the band their first UK chart success, reaching number 12 in the UK album chart (the second highest position in the band's entire career), while the single release, \"Si tu dois partir\", achieved number 21 in the UK singles chart.\n= = Background = =\nOn 11 May 1969, two months before the album was released, drummer Martin Lamble and guitarist Richard Thompson's girlfriend, Jeannie Franklyn, were killed in a car crash as the band were returning from a concert in Birmingham. Simon Nicol later said:\nThat was a big watershed, I think. In the aftermath, we thought a lot about what to do, whether to call it a day. It had been fun while it lasted but it took a definite effort of will to continue. It had given us a lot but now it had taken away a lot: was it worth it if it was going to cost people their lives? Martin was only 18 or 19 years old. He would have gone on to have been so much more than just another drummer, another musician: there was something very special about him.\nAshley Hutchings also said in relation to the album cover photograph:\nMy memory of it is bound up with the terrible car crash. On the back cover we're all eating around a table. The shirt and the leather waistcoat I'm wearing are what I had on when the crash happened. I can clearly remember them being bloodstained. You don't forget things like that.\nUnhalfbricking appeared, therefore, at a difficult time for the group, but was enthusiastically received. After a period of intense reflection about their future they decided to pursue the folk rock idea further and violinist Dave Swarbrick was invited to join full-time for the follow-up, Liege & Lief.\n= = Production = =\nFairport Convention had been invited to Bob Dylan's London music publishers to hear then-unreleased tracks from The Basement Tapes sessions. The band's bassist, Ashley Hutchings, said \"We loved it all. We would have covered all the songs if we could.\" In the event, versions of \"Percy's Song\", \"Million Dollar Bash\" and \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" (retitled \"Si Tu Dois Partir\") were used on the album. The French lyrics for the latter were created during the interval of a performance at the Middle Earth Club. \"Percy's Song\" and \"Million Dollar Bash\" had never been released before. According to guitarist Simon Nicol \"I think the boredom factor was one of the reasons we came up with this wacky idea. Three or four punters joined us in the dressing room; they were either French visitors or students of French working in London, and happened to be there that night.\"\nThe band's male vocalist Iain Matthews left during the recordings for Unhalfbricking to make his own album Matthews' Southern Comfort, after recording just one track, \"Percy's Song\". Sandy Denny sang lead vocals on all the other songs, including her own compositions, \"Autopsy\", and \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\". The latter was covered by many artists and is now viewed to be a classic. The lengthy \"A Sailor's Life\", a traditional English folk song collected by A. L. Lloyd, was already part of Denny's club repertoire. In particular, the version on Unhalfbricking has been described as \"the turning point of Fairport's history from earlier contemporary Americana to English songs\" and by Allmusic's Richie Unterberger as a \"clear signpost to the future\".\nGuitarist Richard Thompson contributed two compositions to the album. The opening track, \"Genesis Hall\", is a slow 3 / 4 waltz, on which he played dulcimer, while Sandy Denny provided the vocals; it was the B-Side of the single release. Genesis Hall was the nickname of the former Bell Hotel in Drury Lane, which had become a squat in early 1969 and later became noted for a mass eviction by the police. In the view of Mojo magazine reviewer Mike Baines \"Thompson's writing reached maturity on 'Genesis Hall'\". \"Cajun Woman\", which opens the second side of the album, features Dave Swarbrick's fiddle-playing in his first work with Fairport.\n= = Title and cover = =\nThe title arose from the band playing the word game Ghost while travelling to and from gigs. Its object was to \"avoid completing a real word\", and \"Unhalfbricking\" was Sandy Denny's creation.\nEric Hayes took the photo on the sleeve design for the UK release, which featured neither album title nor band name. The photo captured Denny's parents, Neil and Edna Denny, standing outside the family home in Arthur Road, Wimbledon, south London, with the band distantly visible through the garden fence. St Mary's Church, Wimbledon, can be seen in the background. Joe Boyd later said \"Unhalfbricking, then, that cover shot was taken in the early spring, right before the crash, I think; and that record came out in June\".\nUnhalfbricking's cover in the US, released by A & M Records, was even less informative. It consisted of a picture of circus elephants with a small inset image of the band, allegedly because \"the group apparently so upset their American label that they replaced it with an image of trampolining elephants\".\n= = Reception = =\nAllmusic's Richie Unterberger described Unhalfbricking as \"a transitional album for the young Fairport Convention, in which the group shed its closest ties to its American folk-rock influences and started to edge toward a more traditional British folk-slanted sound\".\nRolling Stone's John Mendelsohn, reviewing Unhalfbricking alongside Liege and Lief, was supportive, describing it as \"Fairport Convention at its best\" and singling out \"Percy's Song\" in particular as \"the album's gem\". He was less complimentary about \"A Sailor's Life\", regarding it as overlong.\nThe album also gave the band their first UK chart success, spending a total of eight weeks in the UK album chart and reaching number 12. The single \"Si tu dois partir\" spent nine weeks on the UK singles chart and reached number 21. Fairport Convention appeared on Top of the Pops on 14 August 1969, miming to the song and augmented by a roadie, Steve Sparks on percussion.\nIn 2004 Q magazine placed Unhalfbricking at number 41 in its list of the 50 Greatest British Albums Ever, and in the same year The Observer, describing it as \"a thoroughly English masterpiece\", listed it at number 27 in its Top 100 British Albums. The following year, 2005, it was included in Robert Dimery's \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". The Sandy Denny track, \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\", was voted \"Favourite Folk Track of All Time\" by listeners in the Radio 2 Folk Awards 2007. In 2010 Unhalfbricking was voted the second best Fairport Convention album after Liege & Lief by Mojo magazine readers.\n= = Track listing = =\nSide one\n\"Genesis Hall\" (Richard Thompson) – 3: 41\n\"Si tu dois partir\" (Bob Dylan) – 2: 25\n\"Autopsy\" (Sandy Denny) – 4: 27\n\"A Sailor's Life\" (traditional, arranged by Denny, Thompson, Simon Nicol, Ashley Hutchings, Martin Lamble) – 11: 20\nSide two\n\"Cajun Woman\" (Thompson) – 2: 45\n\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\" (Denny) – 5: 13\n\"Percy's Song\" (Dylan) – 6: 55\n\"Million Dollar Bash\" (Dylan) – 2: 56\nBonus tracks on CD reissue\n\"Dear Landlord\" (Dylan)\n\"Ballad of Easy Rider\" (Roger McGuinn, Dylan)\nNOTE: Bob Dylan is not officially credited as a songwriter on \"Ballad of Easy Rider\".\n= = Release history = =\nUnhalfbricking has been released on several occasions and in several formats:\n= = Personnel = =\nSandy Denny – vocals, harpsichord\nRichard Thompson – electric and acoustic guitars, electric dulcimer, piano accordion, organ, backing vocals\nAshley Hutchings – bass, backing vocals\nSimon Nicol – electric and acoustic guitars, electric dulcimer, backing vocals\nMartin Lamble – drums, stacked chair backs on \"Si tu dois partir\"\nAdditional personnel\nIain Matthews – backing vocals on \"Percy's Song\"\nDave Swarbrick – fiddle on \"Si tu dois partir\", \"A Sailor's Life\", and \"Cajun Woman\" and Mandolin on \"Million Dollar Bash\"\nTrevor Lucas – triangle on \"Si tu dois partir\"\nMarc Ellington – vocals on \"Million Dollar Bash\"\nDave Mattacks – drums on \"Ballad of Easy Rider\"\nProduction\nRecorded at Sound Techniques and Olympic Studios, London\nEngineer: John Wood\nSleeve design: Diogenic Attempts Ltd.\nSource:"

                "text": "= 1899 New Richmond tornado =\nThe 1899 New Richmond Tornado was an estimated F5 tornado that nearly destroyed the town of New Richmond, Wisconsin, on June 12, 1899, killing 117 and injuring 125 people. More than $300,000 (USD) ($8,533,000 in today's dollars) in damage was reported.\n= = History = =\nJune 12, 1899, was the day of the Gollmar Brothers Circus, which drew hundreds of visitors in addition to the town's 2,500 inhabitants. Around 3: 00 p.m., clouds began to build, and the sky became quite dark. As the circus ended for the day around 4: 30 PM, a heavy rain, with some hail, began to fall. The rain let up around 5: 00 PM, and people began to head home for the day. By 6: 00 PM, the streets of New Richmond were full of tourists, travelers and residents.\nMeanwhile, the tornado had already touched down to the southwest. It began as a waterspout on the east bank of Lake St. Croix, about 15 miles (24.1 km) from New Richmond, at around 5: 30 PM. The tornado was described as a \"boiling cloud\", which seemed to skirt the hills to the east of Lake St. Croix, and then head straight for New Richmond. Passing over mostly open country, it destroyed several farm buildings near the rural communities of Burkhardt and Boardman as it traveled northeast. Three people were killed there.\nThere was little warning in New Richmond. The tornado was completely illuminated by lightning, but it was visible for only a few minutes before it reached the town. Homes and businesses were demolished and torn from their foundations, flying debris filled the air, and people were swept away. The brick, three-story Nicolett Hotel was completely leveled by the tornado. Some barely had time to scramble for shelter in storm cellars, but many were caught in the streets. Even some who did take refuge were killed anyway, such as those who ran into the O.J. Williams dry goods store. The store was swept away, and the people taking shelter in the basement were pelted to death by flying bricks and timbers. Most people who could not find shelter were killed. Debris of all sorts flew through the air at tremendous speeds. A 3,000 pound safe was flung a block from its original location. Trees and timbers were hurled \"like javelins\" through the air, and the intense winds swept people up and threw them against walls or the ground. The northern residential section of town was completely obliterated by the tornado, with nothing left but small pieces of debris scattered about. Every home in that area was leveled or swept away. The tornado dissipated shortly after exiting the town.\nShortly thereafter, another storm with strong winds swept through, sending people back into their shelters. It is likely that some died in fires while potential help was hiding from the possibility of another tornado.\n= = Aftermath = =\nAll but the extreme western end of the town was obliterated by the tornado and subsequent fires. More than 300 buildings were destroyed, and the only significant surviving structures were the Catholic and Baptist churches. The town's electrical plant and water facilities were destroyed, so fires ran rampant through the scattered debris. Many bodies found in the aftermath were burnt beyond recognition — it was impossible to tell if they died from the tornado or from being trapped and burned alive.\nTwenty-six families experienced multiple deaths, and six reported four or more deaths in the family. After order was restored, authorities determined that a total of 117 people had been killed (64 in the town itself) and more than 150 injured. This is the ninth highest death toll for any single tornado in American history. The New Richmond Tornado is generally assumed to have been an F5 tornado, with winds in excess of 261 mph.\nThe town was so completely damaged that it had to be essentially rebuilt. Damage claims exceeded $300,000 ($7 million in 2006 dollars), however, damages may have been as high as $600,000 ($14 million in 2006 dollars)."

                "text": "= Roger Peckinpaugh =\nRoger Thorpe Peckinpaugh (February 5, 1891 – November 17, 1977) was an American professional baseball player. A shortstop, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1910 through 1927, during which he played for the Cleveland Naps, New York Yankees, Washington Senators and Chicago White Sox.\nNap Lajoie discovered Peckinpaugh as a high school student, and signed him to his first professional contract. Peckinpaugh debuted with the Naps, who traded him to the Yankees in 1913. He managed the Yankees for 20 games in 1914 and was the team captain for the remainder of his time with the club. The Senators acquired Peckinpaugh, where he continued to play until his final season, spent with the White Sox. After his playing career, Peckinpaugh managed the Indians from 1928 through 1933 and in 1941. He was also a minor league baseball manager, and served in the front office of the Indians and Buffalo Bisons from 1942 through 1947.\nPeckinpaugh was considered an excellent defensive shortstop and strong leader. When he managed the Yankees, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He was named American League Most Valuable Player in 1925. He played in the World Series three times: winning the 1924 World Series with the Senators, losing the 1921 World Series with the Yankees, and losing the 1925 World Series with the Senators.\n= = Early life and amateur career = =\nPeckinpaugh was born in Wooster, Ohio, the third child of Frank and Cora Peckinpaugh. His father played semi-professional baseball.\nAt a young age, the Peckinpaughs moved from Wooster to Cleveland. He attended East Technical High School, where he played American football, basketball, and baseball. There, Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Naps, who lived in the same neighborhood, discovered Peckinpaugh. Lajoie signed Peckinpaugh to a contract with a salary of $125 per month ($3,175 in current dollar terms) when he graduated from high school in 1910.\n= = Playing career = =\n= = = Cleveland Naps and New York Yankees (1910 – 1921) = = =\nThe Naps started Peckinpaugh's professional career by assigning him to the New Haven Prairie Hens of the Class-B Connecticut League. He was promoted to the Naps to make his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in September 1910, playing in 15 games for the Naps at age 19. The Naps assigned Peckinpaugh to the Portland Beavers of the Class-A Pacific Coast League for the entire 1911 season. He appeared in 70 games for the Naps in 1912, batting only .212. On May 25, 1913, after giving the starting shortstop position to Ray Chapman, the Naps traded Peckinpaugh to the New York Yankees for Jack Lelivelt and Bill Stumpf.\nThe Naps soon regretted the trade. With the Yankees, Peckinpaugh emerged as a team leader. He was named captain in 1914 by manager Frank Chance. Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player – manager for the remainder of the season; at the age of 23, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He finished the 1914 season fifth in the AL with 38 stolen bases.\nBill Donovan was hired as the Yankees manager in the offseason. In the 1914 – 15 offseason, Peckinpaugh considered leaving the Yankees to join the Federal League, as he received offers from the Chicago Federals, Buffalo Blues, and Indianapolis Hoosiers. After considering the offer from Chicago, he chose to stay with the Yankees, and received a three-year contract worth $6,000 ($140,349 in current dollar terms) per season from 1915 through 1917. He resigned with the Yankees in 1918. Peckinpaugh tied Buck Weaver for fourth in runs scored (89) and several players for eighth in home runs (7) in the 1919 season.\nBy the 1921 season, Peckinpaugh was one of three players, along with Wally Pipp and Bob Shawkey, remaining with the Yankees from the time Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston purchased the team in 1915. The Yankees reached the World Series in 1921, losing to the New York Giants. Peckinpaugh set an MLB record for most assists in one game by a shortstop with nine.\n= = = Washington Senators and Chicago White Sox (1922 – 1926) = = =\nPeckinpaugh was traded twice during the 1921 – 22 offseason. On December 20, 1921, the Yankees traded Peckinpaugh with Rip Collins, Bill Piercy, Jack Quinn and $100,000 ($1,326,679 in current dollar terms) to the Boston Red Sox for Bullet Joe Bush, Sad Sam Jones and Everett Scott. On January 10, 1922, Pecknipaugh was involved in a three-team trade involving the Red Sox, Washington Senators and Philadelphia Athletics, where Peckinpaugh joined the Senators, Joe Dugan and Frank O'Rourke went to the Red Sox, and the Athletics acquired Bing Miller, José Acosta, and $50,000 ($706,859 in current dollar terms). Though team owner Clark Griffith had indicated that Peckinpaugh would serve as his player-manager at the time of the trade, he named Clyde Milan player-manager for the 1922 season instead. This distracted Peckinpaugh, and along with injuries, limited his performance.\nChance, now managing the Boston Red Sox, attempted to acquire Peckinpaugh from the Senators before the 1923 season. Remaining in Washington, Peckinpaugh rebounded during the 1923 season with timely hitting and solid fielding.\nGriffith appointed Bucky Harris as manager before the 1924 season. Harris considered Peckinpaugh his \"assistant manager\". Peckinpaugh was a key contributor in the 1924 World Series, in which the Senators defeated the Giants. He won the League Award as the AL's Most Valuable Player in 1925, edging Al Simmons by a small margin. In the 1925 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Peckinpaugh committed eight errors in the seven-game series, a MLB record.\nOn January 15, 1927, the Senators traded Peckinpaugh to the Chicago White Sox for Leo Mangum and Sloppy Thurston. However, his playing time with the White Sox was limited by a leg injury. He acted as an advisor to manager Ray Schalk. After one season with the White Sox, Peckinpaugh retired as a player.\n= = Managerial and executive career = =\nPeckinpaugh was named manager of the Cleveland Indians after the 1927 season. After the Indians fell from first to fifth place during the 1933 season, the Indians fired Peckinpaugh, replacing him with Walter Johnson.\nAfter being considered for the Detroit Tigers' managerial vacancy that offseason, Peckinpaugh took over as manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-AA American Association for the 1934 season. Out of professional baseball in 1935, Peckinpaugh joined Lew Fonseca on nationwide baseball tours, which involved the viewing of a movie and technical demonstrations. He applied to be manager of the Boston Bees for the 1938 season, but the job was given to Casey Stengel. Peckinpaugh returned to professional baseball as the manager of the New Orleans Pelicans of the Class-A1 Southern Association in 1939.\nThe Indians rehired Peckinpaugh as their manager in 1941, signing him to a two-year contract; team president Alva Bradley, who fired Peckinpaugh in 1933, promised Peckinpaugh full cooperation and minimal interference. After the 1941 season, he was promoted to vice president, later serving as Cleveland's general manager (GM) and president. When Bill Veeck bought the Indians in July 1946, he brought Harry Grabiner and Joseph C. Hostetler with him to serve in the front office. Peckinpaugh and Bradley resigned.\nPeckinpaugh succeeded Harris as GM for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in the 1946 – 47 offseason. He was fired after the 1947 season, as the team's directors felt Peckinpaugh didn't sufficiently develop a farm system.\n= = Personal = =\nPeckinpaugh was considered a calm baseball player and manager, who did not let his temper get the best of him.\nAfter the end of his baseball career, Peckinpaugh worked as a manufacturer's representative for the Cleveland Oak Belting Company. He retired in 1976 at the age of 85. Suffering from cancer and heart disease, he was brought to a hospital for a respiratory condition, and died on November 17, 1977 in Cleveland. He was buried in Acacia Masonic Memorial Park in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. His wife, Mildred, died five years earlier. Together, they had four sons. Peckinpaugh was survived by two of his sons."

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names.\nA total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 28 became tropical storms. 17 storms reached typhoon intensity, of which one typhoon reached super typhoon strength. The strongest cyclone of the season, Dot, reached category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale to the east of the Philippines. Typhoon Cecil was the deadliest storm of the season, accounting for nearly half of the deaths from western Pacific tropical cyclones in 1985.\n= = Season summary = =\nA total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 28 became tropical storms. 17 storms reached typhoon intensity, of which 1 reached super typhoon strength. Only four tropical cyclones moved through the Philippines this season, while eight moved into China, three moved into Vietnam, and three moved into Japan. Tropical cyclones brought Hong Kong 40 percent of its annual rainfall. The strongest cyclone of the season, Dot, reached category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, it weakened slightly before moving into the Philippines at the high end of category 3 status. Typhoon Cecil was the deadliest storm of the season, accounting for nearly half of the deaths from western Pacific tropical cyclones in 1985.\n= = Storms = =\n= = = Tropical Storm Elsie = = =\nThis was the first tropical cyclone to form in the northwest Pacific basin in January in six years. Forming along the near equatorial trough, two circulations formed on either side of Guam. Elsie formed from the eastern circulation, appearing southwest of Pohnpei on January 4. On January 5, further convective development occurred which formed a low level circulation on January 6. Becoming a tropical depression late that day and a tropical storm on January 7, the system moved northwest, reaching its peak intensity late in the day. Thereafter, strong southerly winds aloft arrested development, and weakening began. Tropical depression status was regained on January 8, and its circulation dissipated early January 9.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Fabian (Atring) = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed on the west end of the near-equatorial, or monsoon, trough. Due to strong high pressure due its north, and the associated high winds associated with the northern Asian monsoon, strongest winds within the system were on its western periphery. Strong southerly winds aloft led to persistent vertical wind shear, which limited its intensification is it moved west to northwest. It passed nearby Yap, and caused crop damage as it passed by the island group.\n= = = Tropical Depression = = =\nA tropical depression formed 740 kilometres (460 mi) east of Luzon on April 22. Moving east-northeast for a couple days, the system dissipated on April 24 770 kilometres (480 mi) north-northwest of Guam.\n= = = Typhoon Gay (Bining) = = =\nGay was the third tropical cyclone and first typhoon of the 1985 Pacific typhoon season. After over four months of inactivity, on May 16, a strong atmospheric circulation formed 380 nmi (700 km) west of Koror, now part of Palau. The circulation began to develop convection and by May 20 had organized into a depression. Heading north, the storm took two days to gain tropical storm strength, likely because a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) was so close to the north, restricting outflow. However, the trough soon weakened and outflow improved and the storm began to intensify faster. Gay became a typhoon early on May 23, continuing to intensify, Gay came under influence of a frontal boundary to the northwest and began to recurve to the northeast, through a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by the trough associated with the frontal boundary. This trough began to build and dig southeastward, pouring fuel into Gay's engine. Typhoon Gay reached its peak intensity of 100 knots (115 mph, 185 km / h) on May 24. As cool, dry air became entrained within Gay's circulation, the cyclone began to weaken. Gay underwent extratropical transition as it interacted with the frontal boundary. Gay became extratropical shortly after weakening to a tropical storm early on May 26.\n= = = Tropical Storm 04W = = =\nThis system formed within the northern portion of the monsoon trough on June 16. Strong northeast winds aloft kept its circulation center on the northeast side of its stronger thunderstorm activity. The system drifted generally northwest, making landfall on Hainan Island before dissipating. While never upgraded by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the Japanese Meteorological Agency considered the system a weak tropical storm,\n= = = Typhoon Hal (Kuring) = = =\nTyphoon Hal, which formed on June 19 east of the Philippines, passed just north of Luzon on the 22nd as a 95 mph (153 km / h) typhoon. After briefly weakening Hal restrengthened to a peak of 115 mph (185 km / h) before weakening back to a minimal typhoon. Sustained winds reached 48 knots (89 km / h) at Lan Yu, Taiwan. The 75 mph (121 km / h) typhoon hit 75 nautical miles (139 km) east-southeast of Hong Kong in southeastern China on the 24th, and dissipated the next day. In Hong Kong, winds peaked at 74 knots (137 km / h) at Kwai Chung, and a total of 285.5 millimetres (11.24 in) fell at Tate's Cairn which led to landslides across the region. Heavy rain associated with the typhoon caused 38 deaths (with 14 missing) and widespread crop and structural damage. Damage totalled US $12.3 million (1985 dollars).\n= = = Typhoon Irma (Daling) = = =\nFirst noted southwest of Ponape on June 17, the tropical disturbance moved westward for the next several days without significant development. As it turned northwest on June 25, the system strengthened rapidly into a tropical storm, reaching typhoon intensity on June 27 as it turned more poleward. The system recurved just offshore the southern islands of Japan before striking southwest of Tokyo, Japan as a typhoon on July 1. Weakening as it accelerated northeast, Irma regained tropical storm intensity later that day and became an extratropical cyclone that night. As Irma passed to the east of the Philippines the system enhanced the Monsoon Trough causing heavy rains over Luzon Island. A total of 46 people were killed and 1,500 homes were destroyed. In Japan Irma killed 3 people and left 5 missing. Over 20,000 houses were damaged and 50,000 hectares of farmland were ruined. Damage across the Philippines and Japan totalled US $80 million (1985 dollars).\n= = = Tropical Depression 07W (Elang) = = =\nA tropical depression formed 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) east-southeast of Manila on July 4. Moving west-northwest, the system crossed the central Philippines on July 5, moving into the South China sea on July 6. Moving more towards the north on July 7, the depression moved inland into southern China east of Hong Kong on July 8. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to 47 knots (87 km / h) at Tate's Cairn, where 114.1 millimetres (4.49 in) fell. While Hong Kong considered it a tropical depression throughout its life cycle, PAGASA named the system and considered it a tropical storm.\n= = = Typhoon Jeff (Goring) = = =\nThe monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression in northwest of Guam on July 21. It tracked northward, becoming a tropical storm on the 22nd and reaching its first peak of 70 mph (110 km / h) winds on the 23rd. An upper level trough outran the system, forcing Jeff westward into a shearing environment and weakening it to a depression on the 26th. The shear abated, and Jeff was able to restrengthen, becoming a storm on the 27th and a typhoon on the 29th. The 85 mph (137 km / h) typhoon hit eastern China on the 30th. It brought the heaviest rain to Shanghai since 1962. Jeff weakened rapidly to a depression, but upon reaching the Yellow Sea, it again restrengthened to a tropical storm on the 1st. Jeff reached a third peak of 60 mph (97 km / h) winds before becoming extratropical on the 2nd. A total of 245 people were killed from this storm, with moderate to heavy damage to crops.\n= = = Typhoon Kit = = =\nTyphoon Kit was the first of seven tropical cyclones to form in the West Pacific in August. It formed from a disturbance at the north end of a monsoon trough. The disturbance quickly gained organization and formed into a tropical depression on August 2. The storm moved steadily to the northwest and steadily intensified. The depression became Tropical Storm Kit on August 4. The storm became a typhoon as it made a temporary jog to the north before continuing its northwest motion. The typhoon, small in size, reached its peak intensity of 85 knots (90 mph, 157 km / h) while south of Kyūshū on August 8. Kit recurved in the East China Sea in the face of an approaching trough which caused a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Kit made landfall on the south-western tip of South Korea as a weak typhoon. The storm killed twelve people from resultant flooding and caused significant property damage on Cheju Island and the southern coast of South Korea. Kit became an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Japan. A total of US $3.7 million (1985 dollars) of damage were caused by Kit across South Korea and Japan.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Lee (Huling) = = =\nLee formed within the monsoon trough, and was initially influenced by Kit to its north. Kit's movement to the north reoriented the trough into a more north-south orientation, and a broad circulation formed 890 km south of Okinawa. Moving north-northeast, convection around the system began to organize into a more consolidated tropical storm. The system turned northwest, but development was halted by northerly vertical wind shear. Its circulation center remained fairly broad while it continued to deepen, more like a monsoon depression than a tropical cyclone. As the system passed close to Okinawa, winds remained fairly light. However, winds increased as it pulled away, due to the pressure gradient / strongest winds being well removed from the center. Continuing to move north into a break in the subtropical ridge, Lee moved through the East China Sea to about 445 km west of Kyūshū and stayed about 220 km offshore the western Korean peninsula. By this time, the system was evolving into a more typical tropical cyclone, with stronger winds closer to the center. Accelerating across the Yellow Sea on August 14, Lee began to recurve across North Korea and subsequently weakened rapidly across the mountainous terrain. A total of US $3.9 million (1985 dollars) in damage was caused by Lee.\n= = = Typhoon Mamie = = =\nOn August 15, a tropical depression formed from the monsoon trough a short distance of northern Taiwan. It headed northeastward, becoming a tropical storm later that day. The building of the subtropical ridge to its east forced Mamie northwestward, where it became a typhoon on August 17. On August 18, the typhoon hit near Shanghai, China, and paralleled the east coast of China. The storm turned to the northeast, hit near Dairen, China, and dissipated on August 20. Mamie was responsible for 44 fatalities and heavy crop damage. Total damage amounted to US $13.7 million (1985 dollars).\n= = = Typhoon Nelson (Ibiang) = = =\nTyphoon Nelson, which developed on August 16, moved northwest until reaching typhoon intensity, when a blocking ridge turned the system more to the west. The cyclone brushed northern Taiwan on August 23 as a 90 mph (140 km / h) typhoon. Later that day, it made landfall on eastern China before dissipating on August 24. Nelson caused 55 deaths and heavy damage across eastern China. In addition, the remnants of the storm stalled over the area, killing an additional 147 people.\n= = = Typhoon Odessa = = =\nTyphoon Odessa was a tropical system that was active from August 23 through the 1st of September in the Western Pacific Ocean. Odessa was one of three tropical cyclones to exist in the area of Japan at around the same time. Odessa and Pat would pass very close together with Ruby impacting Tokyo. Odessa formed from an area of disturbed weather that persisted on the eastern end of a monsoon trough. The disturbance organized into a depression on August 23 and continued to develop and it was a tropical storm before the day was over. Odessa assumed a northerly track as it continued to strengthen, reaching typhoon intensity late on October 24. Odessa had become a compact storm with a very symmetrical structure. Its eye was very well defined, despite its peak intensity of 90 knots (100 mph, 165 km / h). Odessa was observed by STS 51 as they passed overhead. Odessa was one of the most powerful, circular tropical cyclone patterns ever seen by spacecraft crew. After moving westward and stalling southwest of Japan, it turned the northeast, travelling along the south-western coast of Japan, weakening along the way, before becoming extratropical on September 1.\n= = = Typhoon Pat (Luming) = = =\nTyphoon Pat developed from the Monsoon Trough situated to the east of Taiwan on August 27. Pat quickly was upgraded to tropical storm status and was named. Due to a probable Fujiwara Interaction between Pat and Typhoon Odessa, Pat moved toward the northeast. Just before making a turn towards the northwest Pat was upgraded to a typhoon on the 28th. Typhoon Pat began to accelerate in the direction of Japan. Pat made landfall on southern Kyūshū on the 30th before accelerating through the Sea of Japan and turning extratropical. Pat killed 23 people through Kyūshū and Hokkaidō and destroyed 3,000 homes.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Ruby = = =\nForming east of Odessa and Pat, the initial disturbance developed near a location with an upper level low interacted with the monsoon trough. The low pressure area formed on August 25 to the south-southeast of Okinawa, moving around the southern periphery of Odessa and Pat. Thunderstorm activity concentrated near its low level center, and the system rapidly moved through the tropical depression stage into the tropical storm stage on August 26, developing an elliptical eye. Vertical wind shear from Odessa kept Ruby from becoming a typhoon. Weaving its way northward, Ruby moved across Tokyo early on August 31 as it lost its central convection. Later that day, the system evolved into an extratropical cyclone. Six perished due to Ruby. Damage totalled US $14 million (1985 dollars) from Odessa, Pat, and Ruby.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Skip = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed well south of Hawaii along the near-equatorial trough on August 28, moving briskly to the west. The system developed into Tropical Depression Two-C on August 30 and crossed the dateline the next day. It strengthened into a tropical storm and typhoon while moving northwest. It briefly threatened Wake Island as a typhoon before a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) recurved Skip off to the northeast. It then recrossed the date line as a tropical storm. Skip became an extratropical cyclone on September 8 as it turned to the north and northeast.\n= = = Typhoon Tess (Miling) = = =\nOn August 28, a tropical disturbance formed south of Guam. On September 1, the system strengthened into a tropical depression and then tropical storm. Throughout its lifetime, Tess moved generally to the west-northwest. On September 3, Tess became a typhoon just before moving across Luzon, with four perishing from the resultant floods. A tornado was spawned by the system in Lemery. Briefly dropping to tropical storm strength, the cyclone turned to the west upon entering the South China Sea. On September 5, Tess strengthened into a typhoon while moving northwest towards China and Hong Kong. Winds gusted to 65 knots (120 km / h) at Hong Kong's international airport and 88 knots (163 km / h) at Green Island. Tate's Cairn measured 204.4 millimetres (8.05 in) of rainfall. Flooding and crop damage was reported across southern China near where Tess moved inland and dissipated. One perished in the Philippines, and two in Hong Kong.\n= = = Tropical Storm Val (Narsing) = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed west of Truk / Chuuk within the monsoon trough, and moved northwestward. After developing into a tropical depression early on September 15, the system moved around a west-north-westerly course, becoming a tropical storm on September 15. As Val passed south of Naha, the system turned more westward blocked by the subtropical ridge and passed south of Taiwan, which caused its center to become ill defined. The resultant tropical depression moved inland into southeast China on September 18. Winds remained below tropical storm force in Hong Kong, and rainfall amounts were light.\n= = = Tropical Storm Winona = = =\nThe initial disturbance formed within the South China sea along the monsoon trough on September 18. Moving northwest, the system developed into a tropical depression on September 19 and a tropical storm on early on September 21. Turning more to the north, Winona missed Hainan Island to the east, and moved into southern China west of Hong Kong on September 22, before quickly dissipating early on September 23. Floods across southeast China trapped 57,000 people, and at least 7500 homes were damaged.\n= = = Tropical Depression Openg = = =\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Andy = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed across the Philippine Sea within the monsoon trough on September 25, moving westward across Luzon on September 26. As it moved across the South China Sea, a surge in the northeast flow helped the system develop into a tropical depression on September 27 before strengthening into a tropical storm on September 28. Typhoon intensity was reached on September 29, and its center moved along the south coast of Hainan Island where winds gusted to 80 knots (150 km / h). The storm continued south of due west across the Gulf of Tonkin into Vietnam late on October 1, killing 46 people across central portions of the country. The weakening cyclone crossed central Laos before dissipating in northeast Thailand on October 2.\n= = = Typhoon Brenda (Pining) = = =\nA tropical disturbance was tracked south of Ponape in late September before consolidating into a tropical depression on the 29th to the east of the Philippines. The depression moved towards the west and was named Tropical Storm Brenda on the 30th and became a typhoon the same day. Brenda then completed a small cyclonic loop on 1 October before turning towards the northwest and strengthening to a peak of 105 mph (169 km / h). Brenda turned more northerly and skimmed the southern coast of South Korea before turning extratropical in the Sea of Japan. Nearly 12 inches (300 mm) of rain fell on the South Korean Peninsula heavy flooding on Cheju Island and near Pusan killed 14 people and left 43 missing. The damage from the system totalled US $10 million (1985 dollars).\n= = = Super Typhoon Dot (Saling) = = =\nThe monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression over the open West Pacific on October 11. It headed west-northwestward, strengthening to a tropical storm on the 13th and a typhoon on the 14th. Dot rapidly intensified to a 175 mph (282 km / h) Super Typhoon on the 16th, the only one of the year, and steadily weakened until hitting eastern Luzon as a 130 mph (210 km / h) typhoon on the 18th. It crossed the South China Sea and hit southern Hainan Island. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to 61 knots (113 km / h) at Tate's Cairn, but rainfall amounts were light as the system mainly bypassed the protectorate to the south. Dot made its final landfall on northern Vietnam on the 21st as a 70 mph (110 km / h) tropical storm. Dot caused 101 fatalities and 2.13 billion Philippine Pesos (1987 pesos) in damage, or US $103.6 million (1987 dollars).\n= = = Typhoon Cecil (Rubing) = = =\nAn area of convection organized into a tropical depression on October 12 in the southeastern South China Sea. It tracked to the west-northwest, becoming a tropical storm later that day and a typhoon on the 13th. Cecil continued to intensify, and reached a peak of 115 mph (185 km / h) winds before hitting north-central Vietnam and dissipating on the 16th. Torrential flooding and wind damage to the area caused 702 casualties, with widespread structural and crop damage.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Ellis = = =\nThe initial disturbance formed west of Kosrae on October 13, moving west-northwest. Slow to organize, the system evolved into a tropical depression on October 16 and a tropical storm late that day. Soon afterwards, Ellis turned westward and slowed due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge to its north caused by a system passing well to the north of Ellis. The storm turned southwest on October 17 due to the building in of a stronger high pressure system to its northwest. By October 20, Ellis weakened into a tropical depression while resuming a westward course as it passed under an upper level low which increased vertical wind shear and disrupted its associated thunderstorm activity. The cyclone turned west-northwest on October 21 for a couple days before dissipating east of the Philippines.\n= = = Typhoon Faye (Tasing) = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed in the South China sea, and was swept eastward through the Philippines due to Dot's movement to its north. The system emerged east of the Philippines and developed into a tropical depression and tropical storm on October 23. Turning northwest, Faye crossed central Luzon on October 24, weakening back into a tropical depression. Back in the South China sea, Faye regained tropical storm strength. The cyclone made a small cyclonic loop between October 25 and October 26 as a system over China approached Faye from the northwest. The tropical cyclone accelerated east-northwest, passing just north of Luzon. By October 28, Faye's motion slowed and the system strengthened into a typhoon early on October 29. After passing Okinawa, strong westerly winds aloft caused the typhoon to begin to weaken. Early on November 1, Faye weakened into a tropical storm before it evolved into an extratropical cyclone later that day.\n= = = Tropical Storm Gordon = = =\nThe initial disturbance formed in the southern South China sea and moved eastward. Its initial intensification to a tropical storm was caused by a surge in the northeast flow to its north and west, and the system turned to the north. As the cyclone became warm core, Gordon was able to restrengthen into a tropical storm after the monsoon wind surge slackened. Throughout its life cycle, thunderstorm activity was removed to the northwest of Gordon's low level circulation. Soon after becoming a tropical storm again, Gordon turned to the west-northwest and made landfall in Vietnam.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Irving = = =\nThis system formed at the west end of the near-equatorial trough. Winter gales in the South China Sea masked this system's existence. The cyclone was first noted just west of the Philippines on December 18 and moved westward, becoming a tropical storm on December 19. As it approached southern Vietnam, the cyclone turned southwest and weakened, dissipating as it made landfall along the Malay peninsula.\n= = = Typhoon Hope (Unsing) = = =\nA tropical disturbance formed along the near-equatorial trough on December 13 between Truk and Pohnpei. The system moved westward, and slowly developed. By early on December 18, a tropical depression had formed, and intensification continued for the next couple days as Hope became an intense typhoon on the afternoon of December 20. Weakening was seen later that day, and its eye disappeared. The system moved west-northwest, threatening Luzon for a time. Just before landfall, Hope recurved north and eastward, sparing the Philippines, and becoming an extratropical cyclone on December 24.\n= = Storm names = =\nDuring the season 25 named tropical cyclones developed in the Western Pacific and were named by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, when it was determined that they had become tropical storms. These names were contributed to a revised list which started on 1979.\n= = = Philippines = = =\nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility. PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility. Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient, names are taken from an auxiliary list, the first 6 of which are published each year before the season starts. Names not retired from this list will be used again in the 1993 season. This is the same list used for the 1986 season. PAGASA uses its own naming scheme that starts in the Filipino alphabet, with names of Filipino female names ending with \"ng\" (A, B, K, D, etc.). Names that were not assigned / going to use are marked in gray."

                "text": "= Re-Invention World Tour =\nRe-Invention World Tour was the sixth concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It supported her ninth studio album American Life and visited North America and Europe. Madonna was inspired to create the tour, after taking part in an art installation called X-STaTIC PRo = CeSS, directed by photographer Steven Klein. She incorporated the images from the installation in the tour, whose name was in reality a dig at Madonna's critics. A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist.\nThe tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque – Marie Antoinette Revival, Military – Army, Circus – Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal. The costumes were developed by designer Arianne Phillips based on the concept of re-invention. The opening segment displayed performances with dance in general. Military segment displayed performances with the theme of warfare. Circus displayed light-hearted performances while the Acoustic segment performances were melancholy. The final Scottish segment had Madonna and her performers display energetic dance routines. The tour garnered positive reception from contemporary critics. However, fellow singer Elton John accused Madonna of lip-synching on the tour. Madonna's representatives denied the allegations and John later apologized.\nRe-Invention Tour was a commercial success. Tickets were completely sold as soon as dates and venues for the tour were announced, prompting the organizers to add more dates. After it wrapped up, the tour was named as the highest grossing tour of 2004, earning US $125 million ($156.6 million in 2016 dollars) from 56 shows with 900,000 fans. It won the Top Tour award as part of the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards. The tour was chronicled in a documentary titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. A CD + DVD was also released along with the film.\n= = Background = =\nThe Re-Invention World Tour was Madonna's sixth concert tour in support of her ninth studio album American Life. In 2003, Madonna collaborated with photographer Steven Klein for an art installation project called X-STaTIC Pro = CeSS. The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices – from yogi, prophet, queen to freak and pole dancer. The publication was a worldwide success, leading to a number of exhibitions in New York, London, Paris, Düsseldorf, Berlin and Florence. After the exhibition was over, Madonna was inspired by the images from the exhibitions and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked Klein to help her with the task. The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project. It featured Madonna in a seventeenth century style dress, crawling on all fours towards the camera. Klein later commented that,\n\"The thing is, I always saw Madonna as a performance artist. And I think what I wanted to portray was the process about how a performer arrives at their work. And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and maybe she would like to injure. [...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result.\"\nThe main intention of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as the Whore of Babylon World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as the Whore of Babylon, the figure of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, to make it a self-confident dig at all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. Air-conditioning was turned off during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.\n= = Development = =\nDuring the rehearsals of the tour, a general setlist was decided where the show rehearsals would start with \"I'm So Stupid\" from American Life, \"Dress You Up\" (1985) and \"Material Girl\" (1984). But \"Dress You Up\" and \"I'm So Stupid\" were later dropped from the show. Other songs taken out from the initial set list include \"Love Profusion\" Headcleaner Mix (2004), \"Swim\" from Ray of Light (1998), \"Live to Tell\" (1986) and \"Take a Bow\" (1994). \"Nobody Knows Me\" was first rehearsed in Peter Rauhofer's Perfect Private Life Mix. The opening song for the show was decided as \"Vogue\" (1990) for a long time, until Madonna decided to use \"The Beast Within\" as the opener. The finale of the show was decided to be \"Holiday\" (1983) rather than \"Die Another Day\" (2002) with the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" (1971) being added to the setlist. \"Don't Tell Me\" (2001) was rehearsed in two versions – a French video backdrop version for the American leg and Paris shows, and the \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" version for the other tour stops. Two new tracks rehearsed for the show included \"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\", written by Madonna and Joe Henry, and \"I Love New York\". The latter was incorporated as a bonus track of the live Re-Invention Tour CD I'm Going To Tell You A Secret (2005) and remade as a dance track for her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), while the former was included in her eleventh studio album Hard Candy (2008). \"Ray of Light\" was also rehearsed during the initial phases, but Madonna later decided to eliminate it, as performing the song at the beginning of the show would hurt her voice beforehand. Finally twenty-four of the thirty rehearsed songs ended up on being the official setlist for the show.\nThe costumes for the tour were created by designer Arianne Phillips. Before the show started, USA Today reported that Madonna would be making five costume changes in the tour. Phillips commented that since Madonna was revisiting her old songs for this tour, hence that was the main philosophy and inspiration behind designing the costumes. However she also noted that \"Madonna has always pooh-poohed the concept of reinvention and doesn't strategize or premeditate her new look in a boardroom, so this is the greatest ironic statement of all.\" The T-shirts were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier and the shoes used were provided by clothing line hosiery Miu Miu. The opening dress was created by French designer Christian Lacroix and incorporated the baroque look. The second part of the displayed military themed outfits inspired from the American Life album and designed by Phillips. The third ensemble emphasized on the emotional point of the show and hence the costumes were quieter and displayed the silhouettes of the performers. The costumes of this segment were designed by Stella McCartney. Phase four costumes, inspired by the carnivals, were designed by Chanel. The final segment of the tour displayed traditional dresses. Other than these, Madonna wore corsets during the first segment.\n= = Concert synopsis = =\nThe central theme of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with different themes: French Baroque – Marie Antoinette Revival, Military – Army, Circus – Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. It began with \"The Beast Within\", an ominous recitation from the Book of Revelation by Madonna and the screens displaying Madonna's X-STaTIC PRo = CeSS installations. Once the introduction had finished, Madonna appeared onstage on a rising platform in a golden corset (for some European shows she wore a lilac one), striking yoga poses to perform \"Vogue\". It was followed by the energetically performed \"Nobody Knows Me\" on a conveyor belt with some of the words to the song appearing on the screens, then \"Frozen\", during which a video of a naked male and a naked female wrestling, caressing and intertwining in water, their faces and genitals darkened by shadows so as to preserve their androgyny, were displayed on the backdrops. This video was directed by Chris Cunningham, who directed Madonna's original music video to the song. The military segment started with the sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies as though in the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing \"American Life\" as war footage of death and destruction flashed on screens behind her (at the end of the song, it showed a George W. Bush look-alike lovingly resting his head on the shoulder of a Saddam Hussein look-alike, as though the pair were waiting for a marriage license). During the performance Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. She also twirled army rifles during a march-like \"Express Yourself\" before strapping on a guitar for rock versions of \"Burning Up\" and \"Material Girl\". During the latter's performances, the backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens. A remix interlude of \"Hollywood\" featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards.\nThe interlude was followed by a Cabaret-like performance of \"Hanky Panky\", which started the Circus act. Next a jazz version of \"Deeper and Deeper\" was performed with her two female back-up dancers. Then followed \"Die Another Day\", with Madonna and her dancers in a Tango-like choreography and backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed. After that, she was strapped into an electric chair as she started singing \"Lament\" from the soundtrack of the film Evita and the platform rises with her to the top. Madonna commented later that \"Lament\" was her \"favorite part, [...] I like the idea of being restrained. I'm singing about all the things I could have had, but my ego got in the way and I destroyed all my happiness.\" The Orbital remix / video interlude of \"Bedtime Story\" was performed as dancers swung on trapezes. An acoustic-style segment started with \"Nothing Fails\", with the guitar being played by Madonna herself. After that, she sang \"Don't Tell Me\", recreating the choreography from the song's video with her dancers. The next song played was \"Like a Prayer\" where symbols of the 72 names of God were displayed on the backdrops. During the performance of the combined \"Mother and Father\", Catholic images along with Madonna's Mother were displayed on the backdrops. Madonna then performed John Lennon's pro-peace song \"Imagine\" when photo montages of war-ravaged children, bombed-out villages and artillery were displayed in the backdrops. Asked why she chose to cover this song Madonna simply said: \"I wanted to make a statement with the ultimate peace song.\"\nThe final segment started with Scottish bagpiper players parading around the stage in kilts and playing drums and pipes. Madonna appeared onstage in similar long kilts and a white sleeveless T-shirt to perform \"Into the Groove\" with Scottish bagpiper Lorne Cousin. A video simulation of the rapper Missy Elliott is played during the performance; later on, Madonna started singing \"Papa Don't Preach\" Madonna wore black T-shirts with the line \"Kabbalists Do It Better\" printed on them. Madonna whirles on the raised platform and sings the song. Other lines printed on the T-shirts for various other shows included \"Midwesterners Do It Better\", \"Italians Do It Better\" \"Irish Do It Better\" and \"Brits Do It Better\". The next song, \"Crazy for You\" is dedicated to all her fans for \"Sticking by me for the last 20 years!\". The last two performances consisted of \"Music\" and the show closer, \"Holiday\" which was backed by a montage of morphing flags on the backdrops. The show ended with cannon shots of confetti and the phrase \"Reinvent yourself\" appearing onscreen.\n= = Critical response = =\nThe show received positive reviews and critical acclaim. David Segal from The Washington Post noted that the \"difference between this show and the last, the Drowned World Tour of 2001, was striking. That show seems standoffish compared with this one, in part because Madonna has finally worked through whatever issues prevented her from performing her earliest hits. [...] Madonna has created a new performance hybrid.\" Segal's view was shared by Elizabeth Smith from The New York Times who also commented that \"Unlike 2001's Drowned World Tour, which was dark, often hostile, Re-Invention returns Madonna to the light. She looks as if she is having a good time.\" Edna Gunderson of USA Today gave the concert four out of four stars and said \"Madonna seems to be having a jolly good time. Whereas her last outing had technical strengths but lacked warmth, Reinvention finds Madonna reinvested emotionally. The show doesn't have the degree of flesh, carnal content or shock value that past outings delivered, but this time Madonna is opting for more heart than cleavage and more personality than profanity.\" Joshua Klein from Chicago Tribune commented that Madonna's show displayed more spectacle than substance.\nSal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented on the theme of the concert and said that \"the best thing that can come out of Madonna revisiting (and reinventing) the past is that she, and we, will be reminded of what she does best: making us forget about the bad times, come together, release the pressure, and have a holiday.\" Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times said that the concert was \"a dense, dizzying, often incoherent, sometimes exhilarating night, starring a great performer who often found herself shadowboxing with her own past lives.\" Dan Aquilante from New York Post said that the concert \"razzle-dazzled her way into the hearts of the devoted audience with an entertaining theatrical revue that was elaborately staged, costumed and cast with a full dance troupe.\" Thea Singer of the Boston Herald said that \"Madonna brought Jewish mysticism on tour.\" John Hand from BBC noted that the \"Re-Invention Tour happily marrie [d] past and present Madonna. [...] It is a far more rounded concert experience for the dedicated fan.\" However Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times felt that the show eventually took on a darker, more political tone and condemned the \"weakly political Re-Invention concert [as] unsexy and uninspiring.\"\n= = Commercial reception = =\nThe first tickets for the tour were allotted to the members of Icon, Madonna's official fan club members. However, the tour soon started selling all around the world. Originally scheduled to perform in twelve major markets in North America with additional stops in Paris and London, the demand for tickets became so high that in New York City after two Madison Square Garden dates sold out in record time, Madonna's manager Caresse Henry, and the worldwide tour promoter Clear Channel Entertainment, decided to add new dates to the tour. Within the first five days the tour was a sell-out for the dates at Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Toronto, Philadelphia and Miami. High-priced ticket packages for all dates on the tour were sold from Madonna's tour website Madonnaviptickets.com. The tickets were priced at $700 ($877 in 2016 dollars) per person. MTV arranged for an on-air contest titled Front and Center With Madonna Contest where fans were able to win tickets to an onstage area at any of the scheduled shows. After the tour started, mid-year it was announced that the tour has grossed US $44.9 million ($56.25 million in 2016 dollars), from the selling of 258,000 tickets at an average price of $174.17. Her average gross per show was US $6.414 million ($8.04 million in 2016 dollars) with still more than half the dates being left.\nBefore the show was over, Billboard magazine projected total sales of $120 million ($150.34 million in 2016 dollars) for Re-Invention. This was confirmed by People magazine who said that the tour grossed around $120 million from all the shows, thus making it the highest grossing tour of 2004. Although musician Prince's Musicology Tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour, Billboard Boxscore published that the Re-Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed US $125 million ($156.6 million in 2016 dollars). At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards, Re-Invention Tour received the Top Tour award during the Backstage Pass Conference at New York City's Roosevelt Hotel on November 9, 2004. Madonna's tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award.\n= = Lip sync allegation = =\nDuring the Q magazine awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows. He commented \"Since when has lip-synching been live? Anyone who lip-synchs in public on stage when you pay $134 to see them should be shot. That's me off her fucking Christmas card list. [...] But do I give a toss? No.\" Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, rejected John's allegations by saying \"Madonna does not lip-sync nor does she spend her time trashing other artists, [...] She sang every note of her Re-Invention tour live and is not ashamed that she was well paid for her hard work. [...] Elton John remains on her Christmas card list whether he is nice... or naughty.\" John later released a statement to Entertainment Weekly saying that he would like to apologize to Madonna for his comments. He said:\nI don't want to escalate it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been to my house for dinner. It was something that was said in the heat of the moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.\n= = Broadcasts and recordings = =\nThe show was expected to broadcast on CBS. It was taped on the final night in Lisbon. CBS reportedly offered to pay $10 million to broadcast the concert as a two-hour special but it did not happen.\nA documentary titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, which chronicled the tour, was released. The documentary was recorded during Madonna's performance on the tour and was finished during the recording of Madonna's tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor. The DVD + CD containing the documentary and a live album of highlights from the show was also released in May 2006. The DVD contained a two-hour long look at the tour, including its rehearsal plus some performance footage, while the CD offers thirteen songs of the set list plus the rock demo of \"I Love New York\".\nThe documentary was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. Barry Walters from Rolling Stone commented that \"Jonas Akerlund's 2005 kinetic yet personable documentary of Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention Tour lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 Truth or Dare doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles to become a less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person. The bonus live CD proves that she's a better singer.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic complimented the release saying \"as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, and even if the excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done.\" The release debuted at number 33 on the Billboard 200 and the top ten in Canada and the European Top 100 Albums chart.\n= = Set list = =\n\"The Beast Within\" (Video Introduction) (contains elements of \"El Yom 'Ulliqa' Ala Khashaba\")\n\"Vogue\"\n\"Nobody Knows Me\"\n\"Frozen\"\n\"American Life\"\n\"Express Yourself\"\n\"Burning Up\"\n\"Material Girl\"\n\"Hollywood\" (Remix) (Dancer / Video Interlude)\n\"Hanky Panky\"\n\"Deeper and Deeper\"\n\"Die Another Day\"\n\"Lament\"\n\"Bedtime Story\" (Orbital Mix) (Dancer / Video Interlude)\n\"Nothing Fails\"\n\"Don't Tell Me\" (contained elements of \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" in most European shows)\n\"Like a Prayer\"\n\"Mother and Father\" (contains excerpts from \"Intervention\")\n\"Imagine\"\n\"Into the Groove\" (contains elements of \"Susan MacLeod\" and \"Into the Hollywood Groove\")\n\"Papa Don't Preach\" (ends with a reprise of \"American Life\")\n\"Crazy for You\"\n\"Music\" (contains elements from \"Into the Groove\")\n\"Holiday\" (contains elements of \"She Wants to Move\")\nSource:\n= = Shows = =\n= = Personnel = ="

                "text": "= Frank Chance =\nFrank Leroy Chance (September 9, 1876 – September 15, 1924) was an American professional baseball player. A first baseman, Chance played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs (initially named the \"Orphans\") and New York Yankees from 1898 through 1914. He also served as manager of the Cubs, Yankees, and Boston Red Sox.\nDiscovered by the Cubs as he played semi-professional baseball while attending college, Chance debuted with the Cubs in 1898, serving as a part-time player. In 1903, Chance became the Cubs' regular first baseman, and in 1905, he succeeded Frank Selee as the team's manager. Chance led the Cubs to four National League championships in the span of five years (1906 – 1910) and won the World Series championships in 1907 and 1908. With Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers, Chance formed a strong double play combination, which was immortalized as \"Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance\" in \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\".\nLet go by the Cubs after the 1912 season, Chance signed with the Yankees, serving as a player – manager for two seasons. He joined the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League as a player – manager, returning to MLB in 1923 as manager of the Red Sox. Chance was named the manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1924, but never took control of the team as he became ill. He died later that year.\nNoted for his leadership abilities, Chance earned the nickname \"Peerless Leader.\" He is the all-time leader in managerial winning percentage in Cubs history. Chance was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in the 1946 balloting by the Veterans Committee, along with Tinker and Evers.\n= = Early life = =\nChance was born in Salida, California, in Stanislaus County, on September 9, 1876. His family was of English and Scottish descent. He was raised in Fresno, California and attended Fresno High School. His father was president of the first national bank in Fresno.\nChance enrolled at the University of California, where he pursued a degree in dentistry. He transferred to Washington College in Irvington, California. While playing baseball for the school's baseball team, he received an offer to play semi-professional baseball for a team in Sullivan, Illinois, for $40 a month ($1,138 in current dollar terms), which he accepted.\nReturning to college the next year, Chance led his team to a third-place finish in an amateur tournament of 50 teams. Bill Lange of the Chicago Cubs discovered Chance and convinced the Cubs to sign him as a backup catcher and outfielder, receiving $1,200 a year ($34,133 in current dollar terms). Chance was scouted by other teams, but chose the Cubs as Tim Donohue was the only catcher ahead of him on the Cubs' depth chart.\n= = Career = =\n= = = Chicago Cubs = = =\nChance began his career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season. Due in part to finger injuries suffered while catching, Chance played in no more than 75 games in a season through 1902. In 1903, Johnny Kling became the Cubs' full-time catcher. As Bill Hanlon, the Cubs' first baseman, left the team, manager Frank Selee moved Chance to first base. Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he agreed when he received a pay raise.\nIn 125 games during the 1903 season, Chance recorded a .327 batting average, and 67 stolen bases; the latter mark led the National League (NL). His .439 on-base percentage was third-best in the league, behind Roy Thomas and Roger Bresnahan, and his 81 runs batted in (RBIs) tied Jake Beckley for sixth-best. Chance had a .310 batting average in 1904, good for sixth place in the NL. His .382 on-base percentage was the fourth-best in the league, and his .430 slugging percentage was fifth-best. Chance also hit six home runs, tying him with Dan McGann, Red Dooin, and Cozy Dolan for third place, his 42 stolen bases tied McGann for fourth place, and his 89 runs scored were seventh-best.\nSelee fell ill in 1905, and Chance was selected to succeed him as manager. That year, he also batted .316 with 92 runs scored and 70 RBIs. His batting average was sixth-best in the NL, while he led the league with a .450 on-base percentage, and finished seventh with a .434 slugging percentage. His 38 stolen bases were sixth-best in the league. In 1906, Chance batted .319 and led the NL in runs scored (103) and stolen bases (57). His batting average was fifth-best in the league, while his .419 on-base percentage finished in third, and his .430 slugging percentage placed him in fifth. When Chance stole home from second base in a tie game against the Cincinnati Reds, team owner Charles W. Murphy granted him a ten-percent ownership stake in the club to show his gratitude. Chance later sold his share of the franchise for approximately $150,000. Meanwhile, The Cubs won 116 games during the 1906 season, taking the NL pennant. The Chicago White Sox of the American League defeated the Cubs in the 1906 World Series.\nChance batted .293 during the 1907 season, finishing sixth in the NL, while his .395 on-base percentage was third-best. He tied Ed Abbaticchio for seventh with 35 stolen bases. The Cubs returned to the World Series in 1907. Though Chance only batted .154 in the 1907 World Series, the Cubs defeated the Tigers in four games.\nChance began to decline during the 1908 season. Though he finished third in the NL with 27 doubles, he did not finish among the ten best in the categories of batting average, on-base percentage, or stolen bases in 1908, 1909, or 1910. Chance batted .425 in the 1908 World Series, as the Cubs again defeated the Tigers, this time in five games.\nBy 1910, Chance began to groom Fred Luderus as his successor at first base. He rebuilt the team in 1911 after Evers's nervous breakdown and the departure of Harry Steinfeldt, replacing them with Heinie Zimmerman and Jim Doyle respectively. The Cubs returned to the World Series in 1910, against the Philadelphia Athletics. Chance batted .353 in the 1910 World Series, though the Athletics won the series in five games. Chance was ejected in game three, becoming the first player ever ejected from a World Series game. Chance continued to transition himself out of the Cubs' lineup in 1911, as he played in only 31 games.\n= = = New York Yankees = = =\nIn 1912, Chance endured surgeries to correct blood clots in his brain that were caused by being hit by pitches in his head. Meanwhile, Chance argued with Murphy, who had been releasing expensive players from the Cubs in an effort to save the team money. The New York Yankees negotiated for Chance's release from the Cubs after the 1912 season. The Cubs released Chance while he was hospitalized, and in January 1913, Chance signed a three-year contract with the Yankees, worth $120,000 ($2,873,131 in current dollar terms), to serve as the Yankees' manager. He also played first base for the Yankees and served as field captain, though he played in no more than 12 games in a season. The Yankees sat in last place on the next-to-last day of the 1913 season, but won their final game to finish in seventh place. In 1914, Chance named Roger Peckinpaugh the Yankees' new captain.\nAfter struggling during the 1914 season, Chance criticized the talent brought to him by Yankees scout Arthur Irwin. After repeatedly seeking to have Irwin fired, he offered his resignation from the team late in the season on the condition that he still was to receive his 1915 salary. After this was accepted by team owner Frank J. Farrell, Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player – manager for the remainder of the season.\n= = = Later career = = =\nChance returned to his native California, and was named manager of the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League in 1916. Chance won the league championship in 1916. He re-signed with the Angels for the 1917 season and was also granted a part ownership in the Angels from the majority owner, John F. Powers. Powers and Chance remained good friends for the rest of his life. He resigned during the 1917 season due to his declining health. He then served as president of the California Winter League, continuing to instill discipline in players: he fined Ty Cobb for \"abusing an umpire\".\nChance managed the Boston Red Sox in 1923. The Red Sox did not retain Chance after the season. But some sources noted that Chance had only agreed to a one-year contract and was not necessarily interested in returning to the Red Sox, a team described by one sportswriter as no better than a minor league club. After his relationship with the Red Sox was severed, he was named the Chicago White Sox manager for the 1924 season but developed severe influenza before he could take the helm. He soon developed other respiratory complications, including asthma. Chance submitted his resignation to owner Charles Comiskey, but Comiskey refused to accept it, giving him the opportunity to return to the team when his health improved. He returned to Chicago briefly in April, but was unable to take charge of the team. Chance returned to Los Angeles where he underwent emergency surgery in April 1924. Evers was named the White Sox acting manager for the 1924 season.\n= = = Career summary = = =\n= = = = Overview = = = =\nChance was part of the trio of infielders remembered for their double-play ability, with Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers. The trio were immortalized as \"Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance\", also known as \"Baseball's Sad Lexicon\", written by the 28-year-old New York Evening Mail newspaper columnist Franklin Pierce Adams in July 1910. Chance helped Evers develop an underhanded throw.\nChance took over as Chicago's manager in 1905. His playing time decreased towards the end of the decade. The Cubs won the NL pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908 and 1910, and won the World Series in 1907 and 1908, to date, the Cubs' last World Series victory. He became the highest paid player in baseball, earning as much as $25,000 ($634,911 in current dollar terms) in 1910.\nChance's lifetime record as a manager was 946 – 648 (.593 winning percentage); his .667 winning percentage as manager of the Cubs is the highest in franchise history. As a player, Chance is the Cubs' all-time career leader in stolen bases, with 400. He led the Cubs in batting average in 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1907. In World Series play, Chance batted .310, recording 22 hits, scoring 11 runs, and stealing 10 bases.\nChance was a disciplinarian. He preached moderation in socializing, including avoiding alcohol, to his players. Chance fined his players for shaking hands with members of the opposing team and forced Solly Hofman to delay his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities on the playing field. In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker for the remainder of the season for using profanity, though he reinstated Tinker two days later.\n= = = = Managerial record = = = =\n= = Personal = =\nDuring the baseball offseasons, Chance worked as a prizefighter. James J. Corbett and John L. Sullivan, among the best fighters of the era, both considered Chance \"the greatest amateur brawler of all time.\" Chance owned a ranch in Glendora, California, which he sold prior to becoming manager of the Red Sox.\nChance married Edythe Pancake on October 3, 1903. Edythe became an advocate for baseball, imploring women to attend baseball games.\nChance died at age 48. Some sources simply said that he died of a \"long illness\", while others attributed it to heart disease brought on by severe spasms of bronchial asthma. He was survived by his wife, mother, sister, and three brothers. Chance was interred in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, Los Angeles. His death was greatly mourned, and his funeral received widespread publicity in Los Angeles and Chicago. Among his pallbearers were Powers and race car driver Barney Oldfield. His estate was valued at $170,000.\n= = Honors = =\nAfter falling short of induction in the Hall of Fame by seven votes in 1945, Chance was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1946. Tinker and Evers were elected the same year. Chance was also elected to the Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame.\nA baseball field in Fresno named after Chance operated from 1935 to 1941. Joe DiMaggio played in the first-ever game at Frank Chance Field. Retired players participated in an exhibition game in Chance's honor in 1937. John McGraw, a contemporary and rival of Chance, considered Chance one of the greatest players he ever saw.\nThe City of Hope National Medical Center created the Frank L. Chance Research Fellowship Foundation in his memory."

Euler proved this by showing that its simple continued fraction expansion is infinite. (See also Fourier's proof that e is irrational.)\nFurthermore, by the Lindemann – Weierstrass theorem, e is transcendental, meaning that it is not a solution of any non-constant polynomial equation with rational coefficients. It was the first number to be proved transcendental without having been specifically constructed for this purpose (compare with Liouville number); the proof was given by Charles Hermite in 1873.\nIt is conjectured that e is normal, meaning that when e is expressed in any base the possible digits in that base are uniformly distributed (occur with equal probability in any sequence of given length).\n= = = Complex numbers = = =\nThe exponential function ex may be written as a Taylor series\n<formula>\nBecause this series keeps many important properties for ex even when x is complex, it is commonly used to extend the definition of ex to the complex numbers.

Nicknamed \"Pep\", he played ten seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Giants from 1917 through 1926, playing right field almost exclusively. Youngs was a part of the Giants teams that won four consecutive National League pennants and the 1921 and 1922 World Series.\nFrom Shiner, Texas, Youngs excelled at baseball and American football at the West Texas Military Institute. After beginning his professional career in minor league baseball, the Giants signed him in 1916. Youngs had a lifetime .322 batting average with the Giants and batted over .300 nine times in his career, including eight consecutive seasons. His career was cut short by illness, however, as he died at the age of 30 of Bright's disease.\nKnown for his defense and hitting, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972 by the Veterans Committee. His election was not without controversy, however, as the Veterans Committee consisted of his former teammates, and charges of cronyism were leveled against the Veterans Committee.\n= = Early life and minor leagues = =\nYoungs was born in Shiner, Texas, the second of three children, all sons. His father was a railroad worker, but suffered disability and moved his family to San Antonio where he worked as a rancher. Youngs' mother ran a small hotel in San Antonio and Youngs had a paper route.\nYoungs was educated at West Texas Military Institute. He received offers for scholarships to play college football but passed on these, as he preferred baseball. He made his professional baseball debut for the Austin Senators of the Texas League in 1914. Appearing in 17 games, he hit just .145 for the class-B Senators and, in 1915, found himself down in the Class-D leagues, playing for Brenham of the Middle Texas League and the Waxahachie Athletics of the Central Texas League; both leagues disbanded during the season. In 1916, playing in the infield for the Sherman Lions of the Class-D Western Association, he hit .362 as a switch-hitter, drawing the attention of the New York Giants, who purchased his contract in August for $2,000 ($43,492 in current dollar terms).\n= = New York Giants = =\nYoungs reported to spring training in Marlin, Texas with the Giants in 1917. They initially assigned him to the Rochester Hustlers, a team in the International League with which the Giants had a working relationship. Giants manager John McGraw told Mickey Doolan, the manager of the Hustlers, \"I'm giving you one of the greatest players I've ever seen. Play him in the outfield. If anything happens to him, I'm holding you responsible.\" In 140 games with Rochester, Youngs hit .356, earning himself a late-season promotion to the big league club. McGraw gave Youngs the nickname \"Pep\" due to his hustle and soon began to groom Youngs to become his successor as Giants' manager.\nYoungs made his major league debut on September 25 and played in seven of the last nine games of the season for the eventual National League (NL) pennant-winners: six in center field and one in right. In those seven games he went 9-for-26 (.346) with two doubles and three triples. In 1918 regular Giants right fielder Dave Robertson left the team to manage a local military ballclub, and Youngs was given the full-time job out of spring training. Batting exclusively left-handed, Youngs responded by batting .302 in 121 games, finishing sixth in the league. It would be the first of seven straight seasons in which he hit .300 as a regular, and the second of eight overall counting his brief stint in 1917. He also finished sixth in the NL with a .368 on-base percentage (OBP). The next season Robertson was traded to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Phil Douglas, leaving Youngs to become a fixture in right field for the Giants. Youngs finished third in the NL in 1919 with a .311 batting average. His .351 batting average in 1920 was second in the NL to Rogers Hornsby.\nYoungs batted .327 in 1921, good for ninth in the NL. In Game 3 of the 1921 World Series Youngs became the first player to record two hits in the same inning of a World Series game. The Giants defeated the New York Yankees as Youngs batted .280 in the series. Youngs hit for the cycle on April 29, 1922. He finished the regular season ninth in the NL in OBP (.398) and tied for ninth in stolen bases (17), proceeding to hit .375 in the 1922 World Series as the Giants again defeated the Yankees. Youngs led the NL in runs scored in 1923, with 121, and his .348 batting average was the eighth best in the league. Youngs batted .356 in the 1923 World Series, which the Giants lost to the Yankees.\nYoungs batted .356 during the 1924 season, finishing third in the NL. In the final series of this season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Jimmy O'Connell, an outfielder for the Giants, offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to intentionally lose the games ($6,904 in current dollar terms). Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led to the lifetime suspension of O'Connell and Giants coach Crazy Dolan by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. O'Connell implicated teammates Youngs, George Kelly, and Frankie Frisch as co-conspirators; Landis, however, cleared the trio of any wrongdoing.\nYoungs slumped to a .185 batting average during the 1924 World Series, which the Giants lost to the Washington Senators. Continuing to struggle in 1925, Youngs batted .264, his only season with a batting average below .300, but improved to .306 in 95 games during the 1926 season. Toward the end of his career, Youngs taught Mel Ott, his eventual successor, how to play right field in the Polo Grounds.\n= = Illness and death = =\nYoungs's career was abruptly cut short in 1926 when he was diagnosed with the kidney disorder that, at the time, was called Bright's disease. He had been exposed to streptococcal infection in 1924. Too ill to play after August 10, 1926, Youngs returned home on McGraw's insistence and received a blood transfusion in March 1927.\nYoungs died of Bright's disease on October 22, 1927 at the age of 30. He went from weighing 170 pounds (77 kg) during his playing career to 100 pounds (45 kg) by the time of his death. In The New York Times obituary, Giants manager John McGraw called Youngs the greatest outfielder he'd ever seen, as well as \"the greatest fighter I ever saw on a baseball field\" and \"the easiest man I ever knew to handle.\" The Giants honored Youngs with a bronze plaque on the right field wall of the Polo Grounds; although the Giants intended to pay for it, fans expressed their desire to contribute and, even though contributions were limited to $1 per person, donations paid for the plaque entirely.\n= = Legacy = =\nOver his abbreviated ten-year career, Youngs posted 812 runs, 42 home runs, 592 runs batted in (RBI), 153 stolen bases, a .322 career batting average, and .399 career on-base percentage. He batted .300 or higher in every season until 1925, and higher than .350 twice. Youngs scored 100 or more runs three times and posted a career high 102 RBI in 1921 and 10 home runs in 1924. During his tenure with the team, the Giants went to the World Series four consecutive years (1921 – 1924) and won twice (1921, 1922). Youngs was a favorite of McGraw, who kept only two pictures in his office: one of Christy Mathewson and one of Youngs. Rosy Ryan, a teammate with the Giants, and Burleigh Grimes, who played against Youngs as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, considered Youngs the best player they ever saw.\nYoungs was included in the inaugural balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936, but received less than 5% of the vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Youngs remained on the ballot every year through 1956, receiving his highest vote total in 1947 with 22%. Ford C. Frick, Commissioner of Baseball, and former teammate Bill Terry both championed Youngs' candidacy.\nFormer Giants teammates Terry and Frankie Frisch joined the Veterans Committee in 1967 and aided the elections of several of their former teammates, including Youngs in 1972. In addition to Youngs, Terry and Frisch shepherded the selections of Giants teammates Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976. Youngs died at the earliest age of any current Hall of Famer. Youngs is the only member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame from San Antonio and was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. Shiner, the town in which Youngs was born, hosted a baseball tournament in his honor at Clipper Field from 2001 through 2003.\nYoungs' selection, along with some of the other selections made by Terry and Frisch, has been considered one of the weakest in some circles. According to the BBWAA, the Veterans Committee was not selective enough in choosing members, and charges of cronyism were later leveled against the committee. This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years. Baseball statistician Bill James recognized this and wrote that Youngs does not belong in the Hall of Fame. In 1981, however, Lawrence Ritter and Honig included Youngs in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. They explained what they called \"the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome\", where a player of truly exceptional talent but a career curtailed by injury or illness should still — in spite of not owning career statistics that would quantitatively rank him with the all-time greats — be included on their list of the 100 greatest players.\n= = Personal life = =\nYoungs married Dorothy Pienecke, a woman from Brooklyn who he met while vacationing in the Berkshires, in October 1924. Their daughter Caroline was born in December 1925. Dorothy feuded with Youngs' mother, however, and the couple separated before the birth of Caroline, whom he never met. Youngs was considered friendly and generous, loaned money constantly, and was reportedly owed $16,000 at the time of his death ($217,962 in current dollar terms).

                "text": "= Joan McCracken =\nJoan Hume McCracken (December 31, 1917 – November 1, 1961) was an American dancer, actress, and comedian who became famous for her role as Sylvie (\"The Girl Who Falls Down\") in the original 1943 production of Oklahoma! She also was noted for her performances in the Broadway shows Bloomer Girl (1944), Billion Dollar Baby (1945) and Dance Me a Song (1950), and the films Hollywood Canteen (1945) and Good News (1947).\nThough not widely remembered today, McCracken was a trend-setter in musical comedy dance. In her Oklahoma! role, McCracken became an instant sensation for a carefully choreographed pratfall during the \"Many a New Day\" dance number. She was considered an innovator in combining dance with comedy, and branched into dramatic roles on Broadway and early television, but her career was ultimately cut short, ending several years before her death at age 43, as she suffered complications from diabetes.\nMcCracken was generous in promoting the careers of other dancers, including Shirley MacLaine, and was a strong influence on her second husband, Bob Fosse, encouraging him to become a choreographer. She was noted for unconventional behavior and was one of the real-life person counterparts of Holly Golightly in Truman Capote's novella Breakfast at Tiffany's.\n= = Early life = =\nJoan Hume McCracken was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 31, 1917, the daughter of Mary Humes and Franklin T. McCracken, a prominent sportswriter at the Philadelphia Public Ledger who was an authority on golf and boxing.\nBy age 11, she was awarded a scholarship for acrobatic work at a Philadelphia gymnasium, and later studied dance with Catherine Littlefield. She dropped out of West Philadelphia High School in the tenth grade to study dance in New York with choreographer George Balanchine at the opening of the School of American Ballet in 1934.\n= = Career = =\n= = = Early career = = =\nIn 1935, McCracken returned to Philadelphia to join Littlefield's new ballet company, the Littlefield Ballet (later known as the Philadelphia Ballet). When the ballet company made its official debut in November 1935, McCracken was one of its principal soloists. In 1937, she went on a European tour with the company, in what was the first tour of an American ballet company in Europe. This put a strain on her health. McCracken was recently diagnosed with type I diabetes (then known as \"juvenile diabetes\"), which was difficult to treat with the medical technology at the time, and the European tour made it even harder for her to stay in compliance with her treatment regimen. McCracken kept her diabetes a secret throughout her life to prevent damage to her career. The disease made her prone to fainting spells, sometimes during performances, and led to medical complications later in her life.\nIn 1940, McCracken and her new husband Jack Dunphy, also a dancer, moved to New York City. At first, neither failed to obtain employment, and McCracken danced in Radio City Music Hall's ballet company. In 1941, she danced with the ballet company at Jacob's Pillow in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts, and later that year joined the Dance Players, formed by choreographer Eugene Loring, with Michael Kidd as Loring's assistant and leading male dancer.\n= = = Oklahoma! and Hollywood = = =\nIn 1942, McCracken and Dunphy both successfully auditioned for roles in the dance ensemble of the new Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Away We Go. Agnes de Mille, who had just staged Aaron Copland's Rodeo for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was staging the production. The show went into rehearsals in early 1943. Like her husband, McCracken was cast in an anonymous dance role in the chorus. Early in out-of-town tryouts, she began to distinguish herself, and her dancing was noticed by reviewers. By the time of the Broadway opening of the show, now named Oklahoma!, de Mille a she had developed her comic performance in the role of Sylvie, with McCracken taking a comic pratfall in the \"Many a New Day\" dance number. She became known as \"The Girl Who Fell Down\". Sources differ as to whether the role's distinctive fall was devised by McCracken or de Mille. McCracken has said the ideas was hers, while de Mille and others recall it as being the choreographer's. Celeste Holm, a member of the original cast, attributed the idea to composer Richard Rodgers.\nMcCracken's performance in Oklahoma! led to a contract with Warner Brothers. The studio cast her in Hollywood Canteen (1944), an all-star extravaganza in which Warner contract players portrayed themselves. McCracken appeared in a specialty dance routine called \"Ballet in Jive\". The dance number received favorable critical attention. McCracken was initially enthusiastic about working in films, but she was discouraged by her experiences working on Hollywood Canteen. Her husband and brother were both serving in the military, and she disliked the film's patronizing tone, which treated servicemen as naive bumpkins who are starstruck by the movie stars they encounter. McCracken also was dismayed by the unprofessionalism she witnessed at Warner Brothers, and the lack of guidance she received from the choreographer, LeRoy Prinz.\nMcCracken broke her Warner Brothers contract and went back to Broadway to appear in the musical Bloomer Girl (1944), set during the U.S. Civil War, which is widely considered to be the first Broadway musical about feminism. She received rave reviews for her performance, which combined comedy acting with dance. While not the highest-billed star in that show, her performance, especially of the satiric striptease \"T'morra, T'morra,\" enhanced her reputation as a comic performer.\n= = = Broadway and television = = =\nShe subsequently starred in Billion Dollar Baby, which opened on Broadway in December 1945, winning positive reviews for her performance. Her starring role in the play failed to further her career, for the show received only lukewarm reviews. After Billion Dollar Baby, she was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in the 1947 college musical Good News, starring Peter Lawford and June Allyson. She received good reviews playing the vivacious Babe Doolittle. Her song-and-dance number, \"Pass That Peace Pipe\", was a standout, but MGM did not renew her contract and her movie career never took off. Reviewing Good Times for The Nation, critic and novelist James Agee wrote in that McCracken \"makes me think of a libidinous peanut.\" I\nIn her study of MGM, The Star Machine, film historian Jeanine Basinger compared Debbie Reynolds with McCracken. Basinger noted a contrast between the two actresses, noting that unlike Reynolds, who was groomed for stardom by MGM and was a show business novice, McCracken was \"faux-fresh\", a Broadway veteran who lacked \"close-up appeal\" and delivered her lines in the hard-edged, Broadway style, \"reaching for that little old lady in the balcony.\"\nMcCracken had limited range as a singer, which prevented her from getting some Broadway parts. Shirley MacLaine described her as a \"small, yet powerful woman with a foghorn voice.\" She long yearned to become a serious actress, and in 1947 she began studying acting with Bobby Lewis, Group Theatre alumnus, who would soon co-found the Actors Studio with Elia Kazan and Cheryl Crawford. That fall, at Lewis' invitation, McCracken became one of the Studio's charter members.\nThe turning point in her acting career came in December 1947, when she appeared as Galileo's daughter Virginia in the New York production of Bertolt Brecht's play Galileo, starring Charles Laughton in the title role and directed by Joseph Losey. Unlike her previous roles, Galileo was a straight dramatic role with no dancing. The play helped establish her reputation as a legitimate actress. She also studied acting with Sanford Meisner and Herbert Berghof at the Neighborhood Playhouse.\nIn 1949, she appeared in the Broadway production of the Clifford Odets play The Big Knife, a fierce indictment of Hollywood. The play was directed by Lee Strasberg and starred John Garfield as a film star who is being blackmailed by a studio boss for killing a child during a car accident some years earlier. At the time of the accident, the studio covered it up, and now uses it as leverage on the Garfield character. McCracken plays a call girl, Dixie Evans, who was involved in the incident and threatens to talk about it. Her acting in the nondancing role was praised by critics, with Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times calling it an \"inventive performance of real quality.\"\nHer next role was not as helpful to her career. She appeared in the 1950 musical comedy Dance Me a Song, which turned out to be a flop, though it was choreographed by Agnes de Mille, who had won acclaim for Oklahoma! a few years earlier. As one of the play's principal stars, she appeared in several scenes, but the choreography was ravaged by critics, as was the play, and reviews of her performance were mixed.\nMcCracken starred with Eddie Dowling, a veteran Broadway actor, in the play Angel in the Pawnshop, in a 1950 tour and on Broadway in 1951. She played a young woman seeking to escape her marriage from a homicidal thief, in a pawnshop owned by Dowling's character. While in the pawnshop, she puts on old clothing and fantasizes that she is living in happier times. Although she engaged in some choreographed dancing during the play, it was a straight dramatic role. While the play was being prepared for Broadway, in October 1950, she appeared on television in the premiere of the Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, playing Essie in You Can't Take It with You. At that time, McCracken gave an interview disparaging what she described as the \"over-commercialization\" of television, which might have hurt her career in the new medium. Reviews for Angel in the Pawnshop were negative, and she received mixed reviews for her performance.\nShe went on to appear in Peter Pan, a 1951 Broadway revival adapted from the 1904 J.M. Barrie play. She starred in the title role in a touring company production in 1951, succeeding Jean Arthur. The play was not a musical, and was different from the subsequent version starring Mary Martin a few years later, but had five songs by Leonard Bernstein. Captain Hook was played by Boris Karloff. Her performance in Peter Pan was praised by critics, and it was her favorite acting role.\nIn 1952, she appeared in one of the first television situation comedies, Claudia: The Story of a Marriage, based on a film series in which the title role was played by Dorothy McGuire. McCracken played opposite Broadway actor Hugh Reilly.\nMcCracken next appeared on Broadway in the 1953 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Me and Juliet. The choreography was by Robert Alton, who had worked with McCracken on Good News. The play was meant to show what it was like to be backstage during the run of a hit Broadway show, and she performed opposite Ray Walston in the \"show within a show.\" Although her performance received good reviews, the play did not, and it did little to help her career.\n= = = Decline = = =\nDespite favorable reviews of her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening health and the failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her.\nAlthough she appeared on television and in dramatic roles, her career petered out in the late 1950s, as complications from her diabetes made it increasingly difficult for her to work. Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.\n= = Personal life = =\nMcCracken was noted for her eccentric behavior. She was uninhibited, and at times seemed to enjoy behaving outrageously. In one meeting with MGM vocal coach Kay Thompson, she removed her blouse and bra to become \"more comfortable.\"\nShe met Jack Dunphy, then a dancer with the Littlefield company, in 1937. They married in 1939 and separated after Dunphy's service during World War II, during which McCracken had an affair with French composer Rudi Revil. Dunphy adopted a gay lifestyle, became romantically involved with Truman Capote, and McCracken and he were divorced in 1951. Dunphy remained Capote's partner until his death in 1984.\nMcCracken met dancer and choreographer Bob Fosse while both were appearing in Dance Me a Song, in which she had a starring role and he was a specialty dancer. She was married to him from December 1952 to 1959. She worked actively to advance his career and encouraged his work as a choreographer. Her intervention with producer George Abbott led to his first major job as a choreographer, in The Pajama Game. They divorced as her health worsened, and as Fosse, who was serially unfaithful during their marriage, left McCracken for Gwen Verdon.\nLater in life, she was in a relationship with actor Marc Adams, and spent many of her final years at a beach house in what was then an isolated section of The Pines on Fire Island, New York.\nMcCracken died in her sleep, from a heart attack brought on by her diabetes, on November 1, 1961. She was cremated at her request. Her ashes, which were given to her mother, were subsequently lost.\n= = Legacy = =\nMcCracken was known for her pixieish stage and screen persona, and for what The New York Times described as her \"overnight\" success as a comic dancer in Oklahoma! The Times described her as \"an enchanting new talent with a flair for puckish comedy.\" Her influence on musical comedy and other performers was considerable. Shirley MacLaine said that McCracken had \"a sense of 'in your face' comedy years before it was fashionable... and she possessed a generosity about other people's talent.\"\nIn her biography of McCracken, The Girl Who Fell Down, dance critic Mary Jo Sagolla says that McCracken is little remembered today, and not widely appreciated for her influence on Fosse, and for her efforts to encourage him to move from dance to choreography. Though her career went into a sharp decline in the 1950s due to her diabetes, she directly influenced the career of MacLaine, as well as Fosse, and was a pioneer in combining comedy and dance.\nMcCracken was one of the real-life counterparts of Holly Golightly in Truman Capote's popular novella Breakfast at Tiffany's. While playing in Bloomer Girl in October 1944, she received a War Department telegram telling her of the death of her brother, Buddy McCracken, a month earlier during particularly vicious combat on the Pacific island of Peleliu. She reacted violently when she heard the news, tearing up her dressing room. McCracken told Capote of the incident, and he used it in the novella. In the book, Holly Golightly has a violent outburst in reaction to her brother's death during Army service overseas. Golightly is shown singing songs from Oklahoma!, accompanying herself on a guitar, and owning The Baseball Guide, which was edited by McCracken's uncle James Isaminger.\nIn Bob Fosse's autobiographical film All That Jazz (1979), the character of Angelique, a death angel, is played by Jessica Lange. Angelique's personality traits resemble McCracken's and she appears dressed just as McCracken was in The Infernal Machine, her final stage appearance.\n= = Credits = =\n= = = Broadway = = =\nOklahoma!

                "text": "= Grill (jewelry) =\nIn hip hop culture, a grill (most commonly spelled as grillz also fronts or golds) is a type of jewelry worn over the teeth. Grills are made of metal and are generally removable. They began to be worn by hip hop artists in the early 1980s, and upgraded during the 90s in Oakland, but they became more widely popular during the mid-2000s due to the rise of Southern hip hop rap and the more mainstream pop culture status hip hop attained. Though grills are fitted to the tooth impression of the wearer, whether they are safe for long-term wear is unknown.\n= = Characteristics and wearer demographics = =\nGrills are made of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are sometimes inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached to the teeth. Gold grills can be made from 10 karat, up to 24 karat gold. The gold can be tinted yellow, white and rose color.\nGrills can cost anywhere from one hundred dollars to thousands of dollars, depending on the materials used and the number of teeth covered.\nAs of 2006, grills were most often worn by 18- to 35-year-old African American male hip-hop listeners, and one commentator argued that grills will never become mainstream. However, grills received mainstream attention, including on network television, when, during the 2012 Summer Olympics, Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte posed with a grill that sported stones in the design of an American flag; he had previously worn diamond grills after earlier competitions.\n= = History = =\nThe insertion of gems into teeth has long predated hip hop culture, with rich Mayans drilling pieces of jade into their teeth. Hip hop artists began wearing grills in the early 1980s; New Yorker Eddie Plein, owner of Eddie's Gold Teeth, is often credited with starting the trend. Plein made gold caps for Flavor Flav, and then outfitted New York rappers including Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap. He later moved to Atlanta, where he designed ever-more-elaborate grills for rappers like OutKast, Goodie Mob, Ludacris, and Lil Jon. Other writers have cited Slick Rick and Afrika Bambaataa as an important early contributor to the popularity of grills.\nGrills remained popular in the Southern U.S., especially in Houston or Memphis, even as they rose and fell from popularity elsewhere, and the rise of Dirty South rappers in the 2000s spurred a nationwide grill trend. During this time, grills frequently appeared in hip hop music, most notably in the 2005 number one single \"Grillz,\" by Nelly, Paul Wall, Big Gipp, and Ali, and in other Paul Wall songs. Wall is known for his grill business as well as his rapping; his clients include Kanye West and Cam'ron.\nGrills maintained their popularity into the 2010s, with French grillmaker Dolly Cohen creating custom oral jewelry for Rihanna, Cara Delevingne, and Rita Ora. In 2015, DJ Khaled created a song based around grills, \"Gold Slugs\" (feat. Chris Brown, August Alsina & Fetty Wap \"Gold Slugs also is used as a term similar to grills with the same meaning.\n= = Manufacture = =\nWhile early grills could not be removed easily and involved reshaping the tooth itself to fit the grill, grills are today made from custom dental molds. For more expensive grills, a dentist takes a mold of the wearer's front teeth with a quick set alginate. A tooth mold is obtained by filling the alginate negative with buff stone, then the buff stone is used to fit the grill to the unique set of teeth. However, for inexpensive novelty grills, a jeweler may make an impression by having the wearer bite into dental putty or wax softened in water, or the wearer may do this himself. Such grills may be less comfortable or dependable than grills that are professionally fitted, and in several instances jewelers manufacturing grills in this manner have been charged with practicing dentistry without a license.\n= = Criticism and health hazards = =\nAccording to the American Dental Association in June 2006, no studies have shown whether the long-term wearing of grills is safe. If the grills fit properly and are worn only intermittently, wearers are at a low risk for dental problems, according to the ADA. The ADA has warned, however, that grills made from base metals could cause irritation or allergic reactions, and that bacteria trapped under a grill worn on a long-term basis could result in gum disease, cavities, or even bone loss. School districts in Alabama, Georgia, and Texas have banned grills for reasons both disciplinary and health-related.\nJust as other hip hop fashions have been criticized, grills have been denounced by some commentators as expensive, ostentatious, and superficial displays that strain the finances of poor youth."

They run four special schools and a centre called MINDSville @ Napiri which offers therapy and residential care. Other MINDS services include sheltered workshops, social enterprises, weekly activities, and trust fund management. Founded in 1962, MINDS is among the largest charities in Singapore, with a staff of 420 helping 2400 beneficiaries. MINDS generates yearly expenses of 21 million Singapore dollars, as of 2005. Two other organisations, the Association for Persons with Special Needs (formerly the Association for the Educationally Subnormal) and Special Olympics Singapore, originated as MINDS projects.\n= = History = =\nIn 1960, the Singapore Children's Society initiated several educational and training programmes for intellectually disabled children, leading to the formation of the Singapore Association for Retarded Children (SARC) in 1962. Beginning with only two teachers and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road, the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s, building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong, a sheltered workshop at Geylang, a residential home at Tampines as well as their main administration centre, Lee Kong Chian Centre. SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally Subnormal (AESN), in 1976. In 1983 SARC launched the first early intervention programme in Singapore, prompting other organisations to follow suit and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore.\nSince the term \"retarded\" had acquired negative connotations and the organisation had started services for adults, SARC changed their name to the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) in 1985. In 1987, the organisation benefitted by being primarily funded from The Community Chest of Singapore, and in 1993 MINDS became the largest voluntary welfare organisation in Singapore, with AESN in second place. Relocation of the MINDS special schools, from premises of closed-down primary schools to new buildings with customised facilities, began in 1998. The association started their first social enterprise, a car washing service along Pasir Panjang Road, in 2001. Their residential homes and training centres were merged into the MINDSville @ Napiri centre, which opened in 2007, and the relocation programme was completed two years later.\n= = Activities = =\nMINDS runs four special schools for intellectually disabled students aged 4 to 18, who are taught various life skills, such as personal grooming and money management. They are also taken on outings to learn how to handle common tasks, such as buying groceries and taking public transport. Students undergo physiotherapy, pre-vocational training, as well as basic instruction in some mainstream academic subjects, including languages, mathematics, art, and science. To help the intellectually disabled gain employment, MINDS trains them for simple sorting and packing jobs at sheltered workshops, then negotiates contracts with potential employers: for example, some were hired by Singapore Airlines to recycle headsets. The organisation also manages several social enterprises, including a thrift shop, a car washing service, a food catering company, and a performing arts troupe, that increase employment opportunities for the intellectually disabled.\nUnder the MINDS Trusteeship Scheme, parents of the intellectually disabled can deposit their savings into a trust account, safeguarded by the public trustee, and after they die, MINDS ensures the money is used to fund caregiving of the beneficiary. Other MINDS services, including counselling, behaviour therapy and rehabilitation, are concentrated at their integrated service centre called MINDSville @ Napiri. The centre contains a nursing home for adults with high support needs, another home for intellectually disabled children from broken families, and a hostel, which provides flexible accommodation options for clients who need less-intensive care. In addition, volunteers from the MINDS Youth Group conduct weekly educational, social, and recreational activities, such as swimming classes and singing sessions, for around 170 intellectually disabled people.\n= = Management = =\nMINDS is one of the oldest and largest voluntary welfare organisations in Singapore, with 420 staff, 2400 beneficiaries, and yearly expenses of S $21 million Singapore dollars. Their primary source of funding is the Community Chest of Singapore, with programme fees, their social enterprises, corporate sponsorships and public donations making up their secondary sources. The organisation is headed by President Conrad Campos and CEO Keh Eng Song, who lead a 15-member executive committee with four subcommittees that meet monthly to discuss problems and plan new programmes. MINDS has won several awards, including the 2001 President's Social Service Award from the National Council of Social Service and the 2010 Singapore Health Award (Gold) by the Health Promotion Board."

The team, consisting of \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and André the Giant, was formed in a storyline that saw DiBiase purchase André's contract from fellow manager Bobby Heenan. André was to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan, but then he attempted to sell the belt to DiBiase. The title was vacated, but DiBiase and André were then scheduled to face Hogan and Macho Man Randy Savage in a match at SummerSlam, which Hogan and Savage won. After the match, DiBiase and André went their separate ways and the team was dissolved.\n= = History = =\n= = = Formation = = =\nPrior to the formation of the team, André the Giant had been engaged in a feud with Hulk Hogan. According to the storyline, André was tired of Hogan being the top wrestler in the WWF and was jealous of Hogan's reign as WWF World Heavyweight Champion. On an episode of Piper's Pit, André turned on Hogan by attacking him and challenging him to a match for the championship. Hogan and André faced each other in the main event of WrestleMania III on March 29, 1987. Hogan won the match, but the feud remained unsettled.\nIn November 1987, \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase announced his intention to buy the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from reigning champion Hulk Hogan. Hogan refused and faced DiBiase in a series of matches instead. After DiBiase lost these matches, he purchased the contract of André the Giant from Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan in January 1988. He planned to help André win the title, after which André would present the belt to DiBiase as a gift.\nAndré faced Hogan for the title on the February 5, 1988 broadcast of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders were not on the mat when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor out of the ring onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. In reality, the second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.\n= = = Feud with The Mega Powers = = =\nThe controversy resulted in WWF President Jack Tunney declaring the WWF World Heavyweight Championship vacant and booking a 14-man tournament at WrestleMania IV to determine the new champion. In the tournament, André and Hogan were booked to face each other. Their match ended in a double disqualification, and both men were eliminated from the tournament. Meanwhile, André interfered in DiBiase's matches, which helped DiBiase make it to the final match, in which he faced \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage. After André got involved to help DiBiase, Hogan came to the ring to even the odds. Savage won the match and the championship, and the rivalry led to a match being booked between The Mega Powers (Hogan and Savage) and The Mega Bucks (DiBiase and André). After WrestleMania IV, Andre returned to The Heenan Family, with the explanation that Heenan purchased his contract back at a profit, but his association with DiBiase continued.\nAt the inaugural SummerSlam, the two teams faced off. Jesse Ventura had been appointed as a supposedly impartial guest referee by Jack Tunney. It was strongly hinted leading up the event that Ventura, who provided commentary for many WWF events and was a strong critic of Hulk Hogan, had been paid an undisclosed amount by DiBiase. Near the end of the SummerSlam match, Elizabeth, the manager of The Mega Powers, got involved to help her team. She stripped off her skirt to expose her skimpy panties to the stunned Mega Bucks, which allowed The Mega Powers to make a comeback and win the match.

                "text": "= Robinson Crusoe economy =\nA Robinson Crusoe economy is a simple framework used to study some fundamental issues in economics. It assumes an economy with one consumer, one producer and two goods. The title \"Robinson Crusoe\" is a reference to the novel of the same name authored by Daniel Defoe in 1719.\nAs a thought experiment in economics, many international trade economists have found this simplified and idealized version of the story important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.\nIn the Robinson Crusoe economy, there is only one individual – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility. The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, Man Friday. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of Pareto Efficiency can be analysed by bringing in the concept of the Edgeworth box.\nThe basic assumptions of the Robinson Crusoe economy are as follows:\nThe island is cut off from the rest of the world (and hence cannot trade)\nThere is only a single economic agent (Crusoe himself)\nAll commodities on the island have to be produced or found from existing stocks\n= = Framework = =\nRobinson Crusoe is assumed to be shipwrecked on a deserted island. Similar to the choices that households (suppliers of labour) face, Crusoe has only two activities to participate in – earn income or pass his time in leisure.\nThe income generating activity in this case is gathering coconuts. As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food he has to eat, and conversely, the more time he spends gathering coconuts, the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.\n= = Production function and indifference curves = =\nCrusoe's indifference curves depict his preferences for leisure and coconuts while the production function depicts the technological relationship between how much he works and how many coconuts he gathers. If the axes depicting coconut collection and leisure are reversed and plotted with Crusoe's indifference map and production function, figure 2 can be drawn:\nThe production function is concave in two dimensions and quasi-convex in three dimensions. This means that the longer Robinson works, the more coconuts he will be able to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of coconuts he gets from every additional hour of labour is declining.\nThe point at which Crusoe will reach an equilibrium between the number of hours he works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function. This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the slope of the highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.\nRecall that the Marginal rate of substitution is the rate at which a consumer is ready to give up one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of utility. Additionally, an input's marginal product is the extra output that can be produced by using one more unit of the input, assuming that the quantities of no other inputs to production change. Then,\nMPL\n= MRSLeisure, Coconuts\nwhere,\nMPL =\nMarginal Product of Labour, and\nMRSLeisure, Coconuts = Marginal rate of substitution between Leisure and Coconuts\n= = Crusoe's multifaceted role = =\nSuppose Crusoe decides to stop being a producer and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce one day and consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two collectively exhaustive markets, the coconut market and the labour market. He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole shareholder. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide how much of the firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices. Let's assume that a currency called \"Dollars\" has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that PriceCoconuts = $1.00. This assumption is made to make the calculations in the numerical example easy because the inclusion of prices will not alter the result of the analysis. For more details, refer to Numéraire commodities.\n= = = Producer = = =\nAssume that when the firm produces C amount of total coconuts, <formula> represents its profit level. Also assume that when the wage rate at which the firm employs labour is w, L amount of labour will be employed. Then,\n<formula>\n<formula>\nThe above function describes iso-profit lines (the locus of combinations between labour and coconuts that produce a constant profit of Π). Profits can be maximised when the marginal product of labour equals the wage rate (marginal cost of production). Symbolically,\nMPL = w\nGraphically, the iso-profit line must be tangent to the production function.\nThe vertical intercept of the iso-profit line measures the level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, has the ability to purchase Π dollars worth of coconuts. Since PriceCoconuts is $1.00, Π number of coconuts can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a dividend of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.\n= = = Consumer = = =\nAs a consumer, Crusoe will have to decide how much to work (or indulge in leisure) and hence consume. He can choose to not work at all, since he has an endowment of Π dollars from being a shareholder. Let us instead consider the more realistic case of him deciding to work for a few hours. His labour consumption choice can be illustrated in figure 4:\nNote that labour is assumed to be a 'bad', i.e., a commodity that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives. On the other hand, coconuts are goods. This is why the indifference curves are positively sloped. The maximum amount of labour is indicated by L '. The distance from L' to the chosen supply of labour (L *) gives Crusoe's demand for leisure.\nNotice Crusoe's budget line. It has a slope of w and passes through the point (0, Π). This point is his endowment level i.e., even when he supplies 0 amount of labour, he has Π amount of coconuts (dollars) to consume. Given the wage rate, Crusoe will choose how much to work and how much to consume at that point where,\nMRSLeisure, Coconuts = w\n= = Equilibrium = =\nAt equilibrium, the demand for coconuts will equal the supply of coconuts and the demand for labour will equal the supply of labour.\nGraphically this occurs when the diagrams under consumer and producer are superimposed. Notice that,\nMRSLeisure, Coconuts\n= w\nMPL =\nw"

The schools of the latter region include Cawston Primary School — held in the town of Cawston — whose principal is Linda Thiel, who also served as a principal for the Hedley Elementary School — held in the Hedley town — before its closure in January 2008, after the Okanagan Similkammeen district voted four to two to close the school.\nBoth schools held students from grades from Kindergarten to Grade 4. The village of Keremeos is home to Similkameen Elementary Secondary School, which holds students from Grades 5 to 12, with the principal being Marcus Toneatto. In addition to the schools of the lower Similkameen, the southern Okanagan holds seven of the ten schools part of the district, as well as its main \"maintenance department\" office, which is held in the town of Oliver. All schools in the district which are part of the Okanagan region maintain the same format: elementary schools have children from Kindergarten to Grade 8, while secondary schools consist of pupils from Grade 8 to 12. This includes Okanagan Falls Elementary School, which is held in the Okanagan Falls town, with Lisa McCall serving as the school's principal.\nThe Osoyoos town is home to Osoyoos Elementary School — whose principal is David Foster — and Osoyoos Secondary School, which is principled by G. Heinrichs. Since 2001, British Columbia has invested over 4.8 Canadian million dollars on replacing Osoyoos Elementary School, as well as Okanagan Falls Elementary School. It offers the Okanagan Similkameen Learning Centre, which consists of students from Grades 8 to 12; the principal of the learning centre is B. Hansen. Its neighboring town, Oliver, is home to, as of September 2011, Oliver Elementary School and Tuc-el-Nuit Elementary School — the former's principal is Mike Safek, while the latter's is D. Foster.\nThe community also had a secondary school, named Southern Okanagan Secondary School, until it was burnt by a fire in September 2011, during the school's multi-million dollar renovation project. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) investigation found no conclusion. The Government of British Columbia are contributing to the school's rebuilding; its construction began in spring 2012, being slated for completion in 2013.\nIn addition to the conventional school programs, School District 53 offers three adult learning outlets, an outreach school, three early learning centres, as well as one elementary hockey academy.

While its board chair is Marieze Tarr, its secretary treasurer is Lynda Minnabarriet and its MLA is John Slater. The district has five trustees. It provides a school bus transportation service, in order to get children to their school and home, being responsible to the Director of Facilities. The bus service has been considered for expansion.\nThe British Columbia province gives funds to the school district, so that it can maintain their schools correctly. The amount given is based on the number of kids that are enrolled for the year. Further money is often left over by the end of the year. StrongStart BC, an \"early learning initiatives\" program, operates at three schools within the district, Okanagan Falls Elementary School, Oliver Elementary School, Cawston Primary School, and Osoyoos Elementary School.

                "text": "= 1970 Canada hurricane =\nThe 1970 Canada hurricane was an unnamed tropical cyclone that brought impact to Bermuda and Newfoundland. The fourth hurricane and ninth tropical storm of the annual hurricane season, this system developed northeast of the Bahamas as a subtropical depression on October 12. While tracking northeastward, the system intensified, becoming a subtropical storm on the following day. The subtropical storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone on October 16, and strengthened into a hurricane about twelve hours later. The hurricane later bypassed Bermuda, before further intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale. Thereafter, the hurricane accelerated rapidly northeastward, and made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland as a Category 1 hurricane. It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on October 17.\nThe system produced tropical storm force winds on Bermuda, which caused the suspension of schools, transportation, and interrupted businesses, although minimal structural damage occurred. Light rainfall was also reported on the island. Hurricane force winds were observed throughout Newfoundland, which caused damage to structures, though mostly limited to broken windows. Rough seas damaged fishing dories and a fishing ramp on the Atlantic coast of the island. The cost of damage on the Burin Peninsula was estimated to be in the thousands of dollars, although the specific figure in unknown. Heavy rainfall was also reported in the region, with precipitation in Quebec reaching nearly 5 inches (130 mm). On the French Territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, several buildings and houses lost their roof due to strong winds.\n= = Meteorological history = =\nOn October 11, 1970, satellite images indicated that a tropical depression developed north of Hispaniola. However, according to post-analysis, a subtropical depression actually formed on October 12 at 1200 UTC. The depression slowly intensified over the next few days, and became a subtropical storm on October 12, thought this was operationally unnoticed by the National Hurricane Center. By October 13, satellite imagery indicated that convection associated with the depression merged with a weak stationary front. As a result, the National Hurricane Center no longer considered it purely tropical and classified the system as a \"subtropic storm\" on October 14. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center began issuing special bulletins for the storm, indicating the possibility of the system acquiring tropical characteristics.\nEarly on October 16, satellite imagery indicated that the storm was developing a cloud pattern typical of a normal tropical cyclone. In addition, Reconnaissance aircraft flight data indicated that a warm core was developing. As a result, the system had acquired enough characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on that day. Later that day, the storm strengthened enough to be upgraded to a hurricane at 1200 UTC. Six hours later, the system passed just west of Bermuda, although winds were well below hurricane force on the island. Spiral cloud bands and an eye feature were observed on radars as the hurricane bypassed the island. The warm core persisted into October 17, which indicated that the hurricane was fully tropical for at least 30 – 36 hours. Early on October 17, the National Hurricane Center discontinued bulletins on the system, while it was located about 150 miles (240 km) northeast of Bermuda.\nAt 0600 UTC on October 17, the system intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale. Six hours later, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km / h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 974 mbar (28.8 inHg). Although a radio bulletin by the Naval Communications Station Washington, D.C. Transmitter (NSS) at 1200 UTC noted that it had hurricane characteristics, the National Hurricane Center did not name the storm. By 1800 UTC, a cold front began impacting the circulation of the hurricane, which caused the storm to weaken back to a Category 1 hurricane, and began losing its tropical characteristics. At approximately 2330 UTC on October 17, the hurricane made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland with winds of 80 mph (130 km / h). Only 30 minutes later, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnant extratropical cyclone curved abruptly northward and later re-emerged into the Atlantic, before dissipating on October 20.\n= = Impact = =\nLate on October 16, the storm passed close to Bermuda as a minimal Category 1 hurricane, causing strong winds on the island. Maximum sustained winds of 48 mph (77 km / h) and gusts up to 58 mph (93 km / h) were recorded. At an elevated location, an anemometer reported sustained winds as high as 100 mph (155 km / h). Strong winds caused the suspension of school, transportation, and disruption to businesses across Bermuda. A riot started by the recurrence of vandalism and arson plagued the island for two weeks leading up to the storm. However, merchants and police were forced to ease their anti-riot efforts to board up their windows. In addition to high winds, the storm also produced light rainfall on the island of Bermuda, which peaked at 1.68 inches (43 mm).\nShortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, the hurricane moved across the extreme southeastern portion of Newfoundland at Category 1 intensity. As a result, high winds were reported across the region; wind speeds of 90 mph (145 km / h) occurred on the Burin Peninsula. Wind damage occurred throughout the island, although mostly limited to broken windows, trees being uprooted, and fences knocked over. In addition, a house under construction blew over in Marystown; another house was abandoned in St. John's for the fear of the roof blowing off. Hydro poles also caught fire in Burin and Grand Banks. Rough seas caused by the storm sunk or damage several fishing dories in Grand Bank and three fishing premises were washed away in Lamaline. In addition, a fishing ramp was washed out to sea in Lourdes Cove. Damage in the Burin Peninsula alone totaled to thousands of dollars, although the exact figure is unknown.\nHeavy rainfall also occurred across much of the Atlantic Canada region, especially in areas well west of the path of the storm. The highest amount of precipitation from the storm was reported in Quebec, where rainfall peaked at 4.9 inches (120 mm) in the extreme eastern part of the province. Rainfall occurred further north into Labrador, with precipitation of at least 1 inch (25 mm) being reported as far north as Groswater Bay. Further south in the provinces of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, rainfall amounts did not exceed 4 inches (100 mm). No flooding was reported in Atlantic Canada. On the offshore French Territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, severe wind damage was also reported on Saint-Pierre. Several homes and a church lost its roof."

The series originally ran on NBC with host Guy Fieri and was revived in 2013 on Game Show Network (GSN) with Apolo Ohno presenting the show.\nThe series premiered on NBC on March 14, 2010, airing the first two episodes back-to-back. A second season began on December 7, 2010. On May 13, 2012, NBC announced that the show would not be renewed for a third season. On February 4, 2013, GSN green-lit a revival of the series, and the first season began airing in June 25, 2013. A second season of the GSN version premiered in February 2014.\n= = Gameplay = =\nContestants are presented with a blueprint for the first challenge (level) and must successfully complete a game within 60 seconds to move past the first level and advance to the next level. The challenges are games that require contestants to perform tasks with various household items (such as releasing a balloon's air to blow a certain number of plastic cups off of a table, or rolling marbles at an upright-standing pencil in order to knock it over). Contestants who can complete all ten challenges win the show's top prize ($1,000,000 in the NBC version, $250,000 in the GSN version).\nThe difficulty of the games progressively increases throughout the show. If time expires or the conditions of the game cannot be fulfilled (such as exhausting any allotted attempts or breaking a rule within a challenge), the contestant loses a \"life\", three of which are provided throughout the game. Contestants who lose all three of their lives have their game end and their winnings drop to the previous milestone they passed. After successfully completing a game, contestants can leave with the amount of money already won before seeing the blueprint for their next level. If they elect to play the game, however, they cannot walk away until that level is complete or they have exhausted all three of their lives.\nEpisodes featuring celebrity contestants competing for charities and teams of two contestants tweak these rules slightly. In celebrity episodes, all levels are milestones, while in episodes featuring teams of two contestants, some games are played by both, while others are played solo. A contestant can only make three consecutive attempts at solo games (including re-attempts following losing a life; an intervening team game does not reset this count). After a contestant makes three attempts, the other contestant is forced to attempt the next solo game.\n= = = Special editions = = =\nBesides celebrity specials and editions featuring teams, other special editions have been conducted by the NBC version of the series. To begin the show's second season, three special Christmas-themed episodes were produced and aired in December 2010. For these specials, two extra games were added, with the 11th game worth $2,000,000 and the 12th game worth $3,000,000. In addition, some games contained a \"Holiday Bonus,\" in which a contestant won a gift if the level is passed. A visual representation of the gift was placed inside of a box, which was opened if and when the level was successfully completed. The gifts included an extra life, an extra ten seconds to be used during a challenge, and a bonus prize.\nThe series also featured other episodes that featured twists to the format. In \"Head to head\" matches, two teams of two players compete against each other in a best-of-seven match. Winning a challenge earns the team a point; the first team to four points wins a guaranteed $50,000 and a chance to play for the million starting from Level 6 with three lives remaining. In \"Last Man Standing\" episodes, 10 contestants play against each other; the one with the worst result at the end of the challenge is eliminated. This continues until there is one contestant left. The winner wins $100,000 and plays a million-dollar game for a chance to win the top prize. In addition, during a few summer episodes, one member of the audience would be selected to play a million-dollar game at the end of the episode.\n= = = Payout structure = = =\nSuccessfully completing a stunt is worth a specific cash prize at each level. Contestants who successfully complete stunts on milestone levels (prize amounts in bold) are guaranteed to leave with no less than the cash award at that level should they fail any later stunts.\n= = Production = =\nAbout two years before the series premiered on NBC, Guy Fieri's agent, who had attended a meeting in France, contacted him, pitching to him the idea of hosting the show. Fieri was eventually chosen to host the series, and the show premiered with two back-to-back episodes on March 14, 2010, airing 27 new episodes through September of that year. The second season, which consisted of 41 episodes, began on December 7, 2010 with a Christmas special. Executive producers for the NBC versions included Craig Plestis, Tim Puntillo, Mattias Olsson, Jock Millgårdh and Estelle Bodén. On May 13, 2012, NBC canceled the series, electing not to renew it for a third season.\nShortly after the NBC version's cancelation, reruns of Minute to Win It began airing on GSN July 24, 2012. Citing the NBC version's ratings success in reruns, the network announced plans to produce a revival of the series on February 4, 2013. The GSN version was hosted by American speed skating champion Apolo Ohno, with Michael Binkow serving as executive producer. The first season premiered on June 25, 2013, although a full episode sneak preview was shown on May 23. The series then went on a short hiatus, returning to air new episodes (advertised as a second season) February 25, 2014.\n= = Reception = =\nIn a pre-broadcast review, Cinema Blend's Kelly West praised Fieri's \"enthusiastic\" performance and his ability to interact well with contestants. West also noted that the show could do well with families and viewers who have a preference to non-intellectual game shows; however, West criticized the challenges for needing \"little to no skill\" to accomplish. In October 2010, Minute to Win It was awarded the C21 / Frapa Award for best \"studio based game show\" format at the MIPCOM Television Festival in France.\nAlyssa Davis of Hollywood Junket called the GSN version of the series \"decent;\" however, she also provided some slight criticism of Ohno's hosting, arguing that while \"he is likable,\" his \"personality is not strong enough to host a game show.\"\n= = = Ratings = = =\nThe NBC version's ratings were generally average, with episodes toward both the beginning and end of the series' run generally earning between five and six million viewers. Ratings for the GSN version were slightly better than average for the network's standards. The first two new episodes debuted to a combined total of 875,000 viewers, with 525,000 at 8: 00 and 350,000 at 9: 00. The GSN version would later climb to a series high of 596,000 viewers on August 6, 2013 while serving as a lead-in to the series premiere of The Chase.\n= = Merchandise = =\nIn May 2011, NBCUniversal agreed to a deal with Wendy's allowing the restaurant to release kid's meal toys based on five challenges seen on the actual show. Several home versions based on the series' format have also been released since the show's premiere. Mattel released a board game and card game format of the show in 2011 and 2012 respectively, while Sportscraft released an \"Ultimate Party Pack\" with games featured on the show. In addition, Zoo Entertainment released video game versions for the Wii, Kinect for Xbox 360, Nintendo DS and iOS devices on November 2, 2010."

                "text": "= William A. Spinks =\nWilliam Alexander Spinks Jr. (1865 – 1933) was an American professional player of carom billiards in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was known professionally as William A. Spinks or (in the initialing practice common in his era) W. A. Spinks, and occasionally also referred to as Billy Spinks. In addition to being amateur Pacific Coast Billiards Champion several times, a world champion contender in more than one cue sports discipline, and an exhibition player in Europe, he became the co-inventor (with William Hoskins) in 1897 of modern billiard cue chalk.\nHe was originally (and again in retirement from the billiards circuit) a Californian, but spent much of his professional career in Chicago, Illinois. At his peak, his was a household name in U.S. billiards; the New York Times ranked Spinks as one of \"the most brilliant players among the veterans of the game\", and he still holds the world record for points scored in a row (1,010) using a particular shot type. Aside from his billiards playing career, he founded a lucrative sporting goods manufacturing business. He was both an oil company investor and director, and a flower and fruit farm operator and horticulturist, originator of the eponymous Spinks cultivar of avocado.\n= = As an inventor (1892 – 97) = =\nWhile Spinks was a world-class player, his lasting contributions to cue sports were the innovations he brought to the game and the industry resulting from his fascination with the abrasives used by players on the leather tips of their cue sticks.\nCue \"chalk\" (used since at least 1807) helps the tip better grip the cue ball (very briefly) on a stroke and prevents miscueing, as well as permitting the player to impart a great deal more spin to the ball, vital for position play and for spin-intensive shots, such as massés. In the 1800s, true chalk (generally calcium carbonate lumps, suspended from strings), and even plaster was often used, but players experimented with other powdery, abrasive substances, since true chalk had a deleterious effect on the game equipment, not only discoloring the billiard cloth but also allegedly damaging the fabric.\nIn 1892, Spinks was particularly impressed by a piece of natural chalk-like substance obtained in France, and presented it to chemist and electrical engineer William Hoskins (1862 – 1934) of Chicago for analysis. He determined it was porous volcanic rock (pumice) originally probably from Mount Etna, Sicily. Using the rock as a starting place, the two experimented together with different formulations of various materials to achieve the cue ball \"action\" that Spinks sought.\nThey eventually narrowed their search to a mixture of Illinois-sourced silica and the abrasive substance corundum or aloxite (a form of aluminum oxide, Al2O3), founding William A. Spinks & Company with a factory in Chicago after securing a patent on March 9, 1897. Spinks later left the company as an active party, but it retained his name and was subsequently run by Hoskins, and later by Hoskins's cousin Edmund F. Hoskin, after Hoskins moved on to other projects.\nWhile regular calcium carbonate chalk had been packaged and marketed on a local scale by various parties (English player Jack Carr's \"Twisting Powder\" of the 1820s being the earliest recorded example, although considered dubious by some billiards researchers), the Spinks Company product (which is still emulated by modern manufacturers with differing, proprietary compounds) effectively revolutionized billiards. The modern product provided a cue tip friction enhancer that allowed the tip to better grip the cue ball briefly and impart a previously unattainable amount of spin on the ball, which consequently allowed more precise and extreme cue ball control, made miscueing less likely, made curve and massé shots more plausible, and ultimately spawned the new cue sport of artistic billiards. Even the basic draw and follow shots of pool games (such as eight-ball and nine-ball) depend heavily on the effects and properties of modern billiard \"chalk\".\nSpinks made a \"fortune\" from his co-invention and the company that sold it to the world.\n= = As a player = =\nSpinks was a formidable specialist and professional competitor in straight rail billiards (early on), and balkline billiards (one of the most difficult of all cue sports), especially 14.2 and later 18.2 balkline, and skilled enough at the even more difficult 18.1 variant to hold his own against World Champions.\n= = = 1890s: Rise as a professional contender = = =\nHe moved to the East from California, as it was the center of high-quality playing. He began his competitive professional playing career in Brooklyn, New York, ca. 1892, at about 27 years of age.\nOn December 19, 1893, in Brooklyn, Spinks played in an exhibition that also featured the great Maurice Daly and young champion Frank Ives, and gave demonstrations of fancy massé shots (see illustration). He also played a 14.2 balkline match against World Champion Jacob Schaefer Sr.; Schaefer won, 250 – 162, with a high run and average of 88 and 20 (respectively) to Spinks's 33 and 13.\nIn 1894, he was living in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in January of that year offered a convoluted challenge to veteran cueist Edward McLaughlin of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to play him either a single 14.2 match to 600 points for US $500 each (a substantial amount of money in that period for someone to put up personally on a bet – approximately $13,675 in modern dollars) in New York City, or one in New York and one in Philadelphia, or one in Cincinnati and one in Philadelphia, whatever McLaughlin preferred, and even offered to pay travel expenses to Cincinnati.\nSpinks issued an even more curious challenge in November 1894, to play 14.2 balkline against (almost) any challenger to 600 points for a $1,000 pot again, and while including French champion Edward Fournil, the bet specifically excluded the top-three names in that era of the sport, namely Shaefer, Ives and George Franklin Slosson. The challenge was accepted by well-known Chicago pro Thomas Gallagher (in a match that future champion Ora Morningstar traveled all the way to Chicago to see).\nSpinks was apparently not a fan of upstart cueist Ives in particular. Days after issuing his caveat-laden challenge, Spinks was described by an onlooking journalist as \"very uneasy until the seventeenth inning\" as a spectator at the 14.2 balkline World Champion challenge match between Ives and incumbent Schaefer; the latter's point total had been trailing, sometimes badly, in all sixteen previous innings until he rallied in the final inning of the game. Spinks, along with Gallagher, even helped Schaefer train in 14.2 for another match against Ives, in October of that year; though Spinks lost this practice match 600 – 369 (averages 23 vs. 14), he had a high run of 109, to Schaefer's 102 (and Gallagher's 157 total).\nSpinks was reported in the press in 1895 to be specifically desired as a competitor in an upcoming seven-man invitational tournament for \"second class\" professional players (i.e., not the top 3), organized by Daly, and with as much as $1,200 (approx. $34,133 in modern dollars) added.\nSpinks had moved to Chicago by 1896, and was perfecting his billiard chalk with Hoskins. That year he was noted for besting McLaughlin at 14.2 by a comfortable 2500 – 2300 margin (with averages of 11 vs. 10) in a five-evening 14.2 match for $250 (approx. $$7,111, in modern dollars), December 8 – 12, in Slosson's New York City billiard hall. At one point he had trailed rather badly, 1500 – 1880, after McLaughlin pulled off a stunning run of 140 (Spinks's highest recorded run of the match was 69).\nBy 1897, the year of the launch of Spinks & Company, he had evidently overcome his seeming reluctance to face World Champions again (perhaps from having several years' experience with his own product prototypes). Spinks competed in (but did not win) a December 3 open tournament.\nThe next month in New York City, a January 15 – 21, 1898 double-elimination, five-man invitational 18.2 balkline tournament was arranged, again in Chicago. It was a handicapped event, featuring the five top players from the previous event – Schaefer and Ives, as World Champions, had to reach 600 points to Spinks's, William Catton's and George Butler Sutton's 260. Without having to rely on the 600-point handicap, Spinks beat Schaefer flat-out, 260 – 139 (with a high run of 48 vs. Schaefer's 38) in his January 18 second game. Spinks (with a high run of \"only\" 44) was defeated in a very close 249 – 260 third game a day later by Catton (high run 56) – by way of comparison, the same night Ives trounced Sutton by a whopping 400 – 160. By January 20, Spinks seemed to be running out of steam, as Sutton took him 260 – 118, (high runs 73 vs. 30), and he lost again 154 – 400 (with another high run of 44) to Ives a day later. (In Spinks's defense, he not only did better against Ives than Catton had, but Ives also had a very impressive high run of 136, making it virtually impossible to catch up.) This loss put Spinks out of the tournament at 4th place.\n= = = 1900s: World-class competitor = = =\nSpinks was still considered a newsworthy contender over a decade later, for the World 18.2 Balkline Championship of 1909, being enumerated in \"a fine list of entries\" anticipated for the March event.\nOn January 11, Spinks (with a high run of 51) beat former amateur champion and then-pro Calvin Demarest, 250 – 199, in only 15 innings – despite scoring 0 points in 4 innings and only 1-point in another – by building several solid runs in the innings in which things went his way. For all intents and purposes it was a 10-inning win. Demarest took his revenge only days later, defeating Spinks in a close 250 – 225, 23-inning game on January 13, despite Spinks's high run of 78 (his highest 18.2 run on record in publicly available sources, and considerably higher than Demarest's 52 that night). Spinks lost to him again the very next day, 175 – 250, in an exhibition game, though Spinks had a solid high run of 69.\nIn January 1909, just prior to an 18.1 balkline championship at Madison Square Garden (in which Spinks was not competing), he and Maurice Daly were observed playing practice games with Sutton for the latter's pre-event training, in Daly's billiard hall in New York City, on multiple occasions over a several-day stretch. While Spinks lost all but one of the recorded matches of this series, one loss was by a single point, at 400 – 399, and another was a close 400 – 370. His victory was 300 – 194 – surprising given that 18.1 was not his preferred game.\nMany articles of the era stress that Spinks was a Californian, because during this period American billiards was completely dominated by East-Coasters and a few Midwesterners.\n= = = 1910s – 1920s: Setting a record and leveling the field = = =\nSpinks was noted in 1912 for a still-unbroken world record run of 1,010 continuous points at 18.2 balkline using the \"chuck nurse\" (a form of nurse shot), and could have made more, but stopped. Later, anchor space rules were instituted especially to curtail the effectiveness of the chuck nurse. The use of such repetitive, predictable shots by Spinks, Schaefer Sr. and their contemporaries led to the development of the more advanced and restrictive 14.1 balkline rules (invented in 1907, but not played professionally until 1914), which further thwarted the ease of reliance on nurse shots than the older balkline games already did.\nIn August 1915, Spinks was tapped to join a consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, organized by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, at that time the organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected to level the playing field in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.\nWell into the 1920s, Spinks was still a well-respected figure in the billiards industry, and wrote articles for publications such as Billiards Magazine, in which he sometimes focused on rather esoteric topics, as in his January 1923 piece on \"Ventilation of Billiard Rooms\" in an era when tobacco smoking was prevalent.\n= = As an oilman and farm operator = =\nSpinks described himself as a director of an oil company at the 1900 census. He invested money from his billiard equipment corporation in the petroleum industry in California.\nWhile Spinks was not operating a farm by 1900, the W. A. Spinks Ranch was a large enough operation by 1909 to employ a staff of farmhands, and included land in Bradbury Canyon, near Duarte, California, where Spinks resided at the time. He described himself as a flower farmer (among other such specialists in the area) in 1910, and later as an \"avocado rancher\". As a pomology horticulturist, he developed the Spinks avocado cultivar. Spinks was active in the growers' community, and in 1922 hosted a large regional farm bureau meeting of avocado farmers at his ranch-land \"mountain estate\". Although active as a floriculturist, Spinks made no known lasting contributions to that field.\n= = = Spinks avocado = = =\nThe Spinks variety of avocado, Persea americana 'Spinks', was developed by William A. Spinks at his Duarte ranch between 1910 and 1920. In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a University of California at Berkeley and California Avocado Association comparison of avocado strains. The Spinks avocado fruit was shown to be more resistant to freezing than other avocados. They also proved to be the second-longest-lasting in storage out of the ten varieties tested.\nConsidered \"famous\" by 1918, the Duarte-based Spinks avocado orchards were contracted to supply seedlings in 1919 for the palace of Xu Shichang, the President of China before communism, and other prestigious gardens in Asia. The Spinks varietal was eventually supplanted in popularity by the Hass avocado, the dominant commercial strain today.\n= = Private life = =\nWilliam A. Spinks Jr., the youngest of five children, was born July 11, 1865, in the then-small township of San Jose, California, to struggling farmer William Sr. and wife Cynthia J. (Prather) Spinks. He had blue eyes, dark hair and a ruddy complexion, and was 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) tall by adulthood. His education is obscure.\nOn September 1, 1891, Spinks married Clara Alexandria Karlson (b. December 12, 1871, Gothenburg, Sweden, immigrated 1872; d. October 4, 1949, Los Angeles); they were to remain together for over 40 years. They returned to California from Chicago before the turn of the century. After a period in a San Francisco apartment (ca. 1900), they lived in the then-rural Los Angeles suburbs of Duarte (ca. 1910) where their farm was, and Monrovia (later, by 1920) where they maintained a modest house. After William's business success, the couple became extensive world travelers.\nWilliam Spinks died January 15, 1933, aged 67, in Monrovia, California. In Los Angeles County's San Gabriel Valley, Spinks Canyon, its stream Spinks Canyon Creek, and the local major residential thoroughfare Spinks Canyon Road (running through Duarte's northernmost residential area, Duarte Mesa), are named after him."

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names.\nA total of 32 tropical depressions formed in 1986 in the Western Pacific over an eleven-month time span. Of the 32, 30 became tropical storms, 19 storms reached typhoon intensity, and 3 reached super typhoon strength. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Vera as two tropical cyclones, when all the warning centers treated Vera as one in real time, while another, Georgette, originated in the Eastern Pacific. Six of the tropical cyclones formed in August, which was the busiest month of the season. Eight tropical cyclones moved through the Philippines this season. Most of the deaths attributed to typhons in 1986 were caused by Peggy and Wayne\n= = Summary = =\nOf the thirty tropical storms formed in 1986 in the Western Pacific (from 32 tropical depressions), 19 reached typhoon intensity, and three reached super typhoon strength. Broken down by month, one tropical cyclone formed in February, one in April, two in May, three in June, three in July, seven in August, three in September, four in October, six in November, and two forming in December. Vera was considered two tropical cyclones by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center after the fact, though it was operationally treated as one system, and Georgette, was a former Eastern Pacific cyclone. Eight tropical cyclones moved through the Philippines this season, while three struck mainland China, one struck Korea, and one crossed the Japanese coast. Peggy and Wayne accounted for a majority of the death toll this season. Tropical cyclones accounted for 35 percent of the annual rainfall in Hong Kong this year.\n= = Storms = =\n= = = Typhoon Judy (Akang) = = =\nThe initial disturbance formed within two degrees of the equator within the monsoon trough on January 25. Over succeeding days, the thunderstorm area increased in size. However, it decreased significantly on January 30. As the convective area moved slowly westward, it increased in coverage once more, organizing into a tropical depression on February 1. Moving on a parabolic course east of the Philippines, Judy gained tropical storm status on February 2, and typhoon strength on February 4 after recurving to the northwest of the subtropical ridge. As westerly winds increased aloft, vertical wind shear weakened Judy back into a tropical storm, which lost tropical characteristics on February 6. After drifting slightly more east-northeastward, the low pressure area dissipated.\n= = = Typhoon Ken (Bising) = = =\nA tropical disturbance formed along the near equatorial trough on April 20 well to the south of Guam. The system slowly increased in organization, becoming a tropical depression on April 26. The system quickly developed thereafter, becoming a typhoon on April 27 while moving northward. The system reached its peak intensity on April 28. The subtropical ridge built to its northwest, steering Ken to the west. South-westerly vertical wind shear led to a weakening trend to begin on April 29. On April 30, Ken's low level circulation was exposed, no longer having any thunderstorms near the center. The remnant low drifted westward, dissipating by May 3.\n= = = Super Typhoon Lola = = =\nForming as a twin cyclone with Namu, which formed in the southern hemisphere, the initial disturbance of Lola developed within the monsoon trough south of Guam. Moving eastward, the system slowly developed becoming a tropical depression, then a tropical storm, on May 17. Lola moved over Pohnpei, becoming their most destructive cyclone since 1958. In light of the damage caused by the storm, the island was declared a major disaster area on June 3 by the American government. Continuing to intensify, Lola became a typhoon on May 18 and turned northwest. Rapid intensification continued, with Lola becoming a super typhoon on May 19. Peaking in intensity on May 20, Lola recurved to the north and northeast, weakening into a tropical storm on May 23 and evolving into an extratropical cyclone later that day.\n= = = Tropical Storm Mac (Klaring) = = =\nThis system moved generally to the east-northeast throughout its life cycle. Forming near Hainan Island on May 21 as a monsoon depression, the initial tropical disturbance moved through the South China sea while slowly organizing. Becoming a tropical depression in the Formosa Strait, Mac quickly became a tropical storm and turned northeast, paralleling the coast of Taiwan. On May 27, Mac turned back towards the east-northeast as upper level westerly winds increased, causing vertical wind shear which led to Mac weakening into a tropical depression before dissipating on May 29.\n= = = Typhoon Nancy (Deling) = = =\nA broad area of convection formed to the southeast of Pohnpei in mid June. The convection formed a tropical depression on June 21 to the east of the Philippines. Tropical Storm Nancy was named the next and quickly strengthened into a typhoon with max winds of 75 kn (139 km / h) before striking northeastern Taiwan. After departing the island Nancy weakened to tropical storm strength while moving north through the East China Sea. Nancy passed through the Korea Straits just before turning extratropical and accelerating northeastward into the Sea of Japan. Torrential rains fell throughout South Korea, as a result of flooding 12 people were killed and 22,477 acres (90.96 km2) of farmland were destroyed.\n= = = Tropical Storm Owen (Emang) = = =\nForming as a tropical disturbance southwest of Kosrae on June 21. Moving west-northwest, the system gradually became better organized. On June 28, the disturbance had organized into a tropical depression. Recurving east of the Philippines and Taiwan, Owen developed into a tropical storm, reaching its maximum intensity on June 29. Thereafter, east-northeasterly winds aloft led to vertical wind shear which weakened Owen. While moving north-northeast towards southern Japan, the system devolved into a low level circulation devoid of thunderstorms, and dissipated on July 2.\n= = = Super Typhoon Peggy (Gading) = = =\nTyphoon Peggy, which developed on July 3 east of the Philippines, steadily strengthened to reach a peak of 130 knots (240 km / h) super typhoon on July 7. As Peggy continued westward, it slowly weakened, and hit northeastern Luzon on July 9 as a 90 kn (170 km / h) typhoon. A slight weakening of the subtropical ridge brought Peggy more northward, where it hit southeastern China as a 55 kn (102 km / h) tropical storm on the July 11. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to 78 knots (144 km / h) at Tate's Cairn and rainfall totals reached 449 millimetres (17.7 in) at Tai Mo Shan. Peggy's fury resulted in 333 casualties and US $2.5 million (1986 dollars) in damage from torrential flooding.\n= = = Typhoon Roger (Heling) = = =\nAn upper level low retrograded westward across the tropical Pacific ocean beginning on July 4. On July 8, a tropical disturbance formed southeast of the upper low southwest of Enewetak Atoll. The system moved westward, slowly organizing. Becoming a tropical depression on July 13, the small system turned northwest, recurving gradually around a subtropical ridge to its east and northeast. The system strengthened into a tropical storm later on July 13, and a typhoon on July 14 to the south of Japan. After turning to the northeast, the system began to experience northeasterly vertical wind shear and began to weaken. After passing east of Okinawa, the system began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, a process which completed on July 17 near the southern coast of Japan.\n= = = July Tropical Storm = = =\nForming on the South China sea on July 19, the cyclone moved northwest into mainland China on July 22, maintaining its circulation as it turned westward before dissipating on July 24. This system was recognized by the Japanese Meteorological Agency as a tropical storm.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Sarah (Iliang) = = =\nDeveloping in the Philippine Sea on July 30, the system developed as it moved westward, becoming a tropical storm on July 31. On August 1, its mid-level circulation center crossed into the South China sea while its surface circulation was left behind east of the Philippines. Sarah's broad circulation center was difficult to locate until it began moving northeast east of Luzon on August 2, when it intensified to its peak intensity. As Sarah moved east of Honshu, it evolved into an extratropical cyclone. Fourteen died in Japan due to Sarah.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Georgette = = =\nFrom August 3 to August 4, Tropical Storm Georgette existed in the Eastern Pacific, but degraded into a tropical wave while moving rapidly westward. Five days later in the Western Pacific, Georgette regenerated into a tropical storm, and became a typhoon on August 10. At this time, a tropical disturbance was developing to its west, and it became Tropical Storm Tip on the 11th. Tip and Georgette underwent fujiwhara interaction, causing smaller Georgette to loop as the larger storm Tip headed to the north. Georgette weakened to a tropical depression on August 15, and was absorbed by Tip's large inflow band on August 16.\n= = = August Tropical Storm = = =\nThis system formed in the South China sea on August 9, and moved northwest through Hainan Island into mainland China, dissipating on August 12. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to 70 knots (130 km / h) at Tate's Cairn and Tai Mo Shan while Tai Po received 343 millimetres (13.5 in) of rainfall from the depression. Extensive flooding occurred on Hainan and western Guangdong Province, killing two people. The Hong Kong Royal Observatory considered this system a tropical depression.\n= = = Typhoon Tip = = =\nGeorgette became a typhoon on August 10 to the east of a tropical disturbance, which developed into Tropical Storm Tip on August 11. Tip and Georgette underwent the Fujiwhara effect, causing smaller Georgette to loop as the larger storm Tip headed to the north. Georgette became absorbed by Tip's large inflow band on August 16. Tip strengthened to a typhoon, and reached a peak intensity of 80 kn (150 km / h) winds before vertical wind shear caused the system to weaken. On August 19, Tip became extratropical, and persisted as a remnant low for six more days.\n= = = Typhoon Vera (Loleng) = = =\nThe most intense and extensive monsoon trough since 1974 spawned a tropical depression on August 15. It drifted to the southeast, relocating several times in its formative stages. On August 16 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Vera, and operationally the storm was to continue eastward, continuing to relocate in the broad monsoon trough and becoming a storm again on August 17 after weakening. Post-analysis by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center suggested that the first storm turned to the west and dissipated, and that a new, separate storm formed well to the east on August 17. However, the Japan Meteorological Agency maintained the system as a single storm.\nVera drifted northward until an upper level ridge forced the storm to the east, providing upper level outflow for Vera to strengthen to a typhoon on August 20. On August 22, Vera attained winds of 165 km / h (105 mph) before the weakening ridge forced the typhoon to the west, retracing its path it took days before. The typhoon slowly weakened, and hit Okinawa on August 25 as a 155 km / h (100 mph) typhoon. Vera turned to the northeast, hit South Korea on August 28 as a minimal typhoon, and became extratropical on August 29 in the Sea of Japan. A total of 23 people were killed from the storm, with moderate to heavy damage in its path as far north as the Soviet Far East. Damage totalled US $22 million (1986 dollars) across South Korea.\n= = = Typhoon Wayne (Miding) = = =\nOne of the longest lasting Western Pacific system on record began its long life on August 16 in the South China Sea, having formed from the monsoon trough. It drifted to the southwest, then looped back to the northwest, becoming a tropical storm on August 18. Wayne turned to the northeast and became a typhoon on August 19. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to 78 knots (144 km / h) at Tate's Cairn. The typhoon passed offshore of southeastern China and hit western Taiwan on August 22. Wayne turned back to the south and southwest. Vertical shear caused Wayne to weaken to a depression on August 25. Wayne turned back to the northeast, rotating around Vera. Once Vera accelerated away, Wayne drifted northeastward through the South China Sea, becoming a tropical storm on August 27.\nWayne turned southward, becoming a typhoon again on August 30. Wayne passed close to northern Luzon on September 2 before turning back to the west. Two days later while moving quickly westward through the South China Sea, Wayne reached a peak of 85 knots (157 km / h) winds. During its various passages of Hong Kong, a total of 295 millimetres (11.6 in) of rainfall accumulated at Sai Kung. The cyclone hit northern Hainan on September 5, entered the Gulf of Tonkin, and made its final landfall on northern Vietnam later that day as a 60 knots (110 km / h) tropical storm. The next day, Wayne dissipated over Vietnam, after 85 advisories and being the longest lasting Western Pacific system in history. Wayne brought torrential rains through its path to the Philippines, Taiwan, southeastern China, Hainan Island, and Vietnam. Because of this, 490 fatalities (most in Vietnam), tens of thousands left homeless, and US $399 million (1986 dollars) in damage can be attributed to Typhoon Wayne.\n= = = September Tropical Storm = = =\nOriginating in the subtropical west-central Pacific, this large cyclone moved westward to a point south of Japan before becoming a tropical storm. Soon afterward, the system recurved across central Japan on September 2 and evolved into an extratropical cyclone as it returned to the northern Pacific ocean on September 3. This system was recognized by the Japanese Meteorological Agency as a tropical storm, and the Hong Kong Royal Observatory as a tropical depression.\n= = = Typhoon Abby (Norming) = = =\nTyphoon Abby developed from an area of persistent convection to the southwest of Truk in early August. A tropical depression formed on August 13 to the southeast of Guam and was upgraded to a tropical storm a day after passing south of the island. Abby then steadily intensified to a peak of 95 kn (176 km / h) but weakened before striking Taiwan. Typhoon Abby lashed the island with winds of 85 kn (157 km / h) and heavy rains. Flooding on Taiwan killed 13 people, and agricultural damage totalled $81 million (1986 USD, $173 million 2013 USD). After departing Taiwan Abby continued north-northeast before dissipating in the East China Sea.\n= = = Typhoon Ben = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed near Majuro on September 15. The system moved west-northwest, becoming a tropical depression on September 18 and a tropical storm on September 19. Thirteen perished on a fishing vessel passing by Pagan as Ben passed nearby. Ben turned north-northwest for a day and a half, moving around an upper level cyclone in its vicinity, before resuming a west-northwest track on September 20. Vertical wind shear, caused by strong north-northeast winds aloft, weakened Ben to minimal tropical storm intensity by September 21. Ben entered a more favourable environment, achieving typhoon intensity on September 23 before rounding the southwest portion of the subtropical ridge. Ben recurved to the northeast on September 26, moving well to the east of Japan, as vertical wind shear increased due to strengthening winds aloft from the southwest. Ben subsequently weakened back into a tropical storm on September 30 before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day.\n= = = Typhoon Carmen = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance was first noted to the east-southeast of Majuro on September 27. The system tracked north of due west, before consolidating slowly into a tropical depression on September 30 and a tropical storm on October 2. After passing between Rota and Saipan, Carmen turned northwest and intensified into a typhoon on October 4. Winds at Rota peaked at 53 knots (98 km / h) as it passed by the island. Heavy rains fell at Guam, where amounts totalled between 254 millimetres (10.0 in) and 279 millimetres (11.0 in). Moving through a break in the subtropical ridge, Carmen rapidly strengthened as it turned north, then northeast, on October 6 when maximum sustained winds reached 100 knots (190 km / h). As vertical wind shear increased due to strengthening southwest winds aloft, the cyclone weakened into a tropical storm on October 8, evolving into an extratropical cyclone by October 9.\n= = = Tropical Storm Dom (Oyang) = = =\nInitially noted as a tropical disturbance in the Philippine Sea on October 2, the system moved slowly west-northwest to the south of the subtropical ridge, becoming a tropical depression on October 4. Crossing the Philippines, the depression caused heavy rainfall and flooding as it emerged into the South China sea and developed into a tropical storm on October 9. Development was slow due to strong upper level winds from the northeast displacing thunderstorms west-southwest of its center. Continuing to track north of due west, Dom made landfall in Vietnam and dissipated as it moved along the Laos / Vietnam border on October 12. A total of 16 perished and damage totalled US $4 million (1986 dollars) in Luzon.\n= = = Typhoon Ellen (Pasing) = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed just west of the International Dateline within the monsoon trough on October 3. The system moved westward for nearly a week without significant development. Becoming a tropical depression on October 9 and a tropical storm on October 11, the cyclone turned to the west-northwest, moving through the central Philippines into the South China sea. Turning more northerly, Ellen intensified to a typhoon while paralleling the west coast of Luzon on October 14. By October 15, Ellen's track became increasingly more westerly due to a building surface high pressure area to its north. Weakening began due to westerly winds aloft and land interaction with China, and Ellen dropped back to tropical storm strength on October 17. The cyclone moved south of Hong Kong and north of Hainan Island into mainland China on October 19. In Hong Kong, winds gusted to 78 knots (144 km / h) at Tai Mo Shan. As it neared the border between Vietnam and China, Ellen dissipated on October 20.\n= = = Typhoon Forrest = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed near the International Dateline on October 10 before moving on a parabolic track well east of Asia. A small system, it moved west-northwest and organized into a tropical depression on October 15, then a tropical storm later in the day. Late on October 16, Forrest intensified into a typhoon. The next day, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 100 knots (190 km / h) and passed near the island of Agrihan where one building was left standing and communications were eliminated. Forrest then recurved south-southeast of Iwo Jima. As winds aloft increased out of the west, Forrest slowly weakened, becoming a tropical storm once more on October 20 and evolving into an extratropical cyclone by October 21.\n= = = Tropical Storm Georgia (Ruping) = = =\nFirst noted as a tropical disturbance east of Ulithi within the monsoon trough on October 14, the system moved north of due west. Slowly developing, the system evolved into a tropical depression on October 17 and tropical storm on October 18. The cyclone reached its peak intensity before it crossed the central Philippines on October 19 and emerged into the South China sea. On October 22, Georgia made landfall across Vietnam and crossed Laos into Thailand. The system subsequently dissipated by October 23.\n= = = Tropical Depression Susang = = =\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Herbert (Tering) = = =\nForming as a tropical disturbance near the International Dateline on October 29, the system moved westward at low latitude eventually organizing into a tropical depression on November 3 south of Guam.

The system organized into a tropical depression on November 10, then tropical storm on November 11, while moving towards the Philippines. Six days after Herbert, Ida crossed the central portion of the archipelago between November 12 and 13. Interaction with the islands weakened the system back into a tropical depression before emerging into the South China sea. Strengthening back into a tropical storm on November 14, Ida transcribed an anticyclonic, or clockwise, loop, weakening back into a tropical depression on November 16 while moving to the south due to strong southwest winds aloft. The depression moved south-southwest before dissipating on November 19. Two died when a cargo ship sank near Dongsha.\n= = = Typhoon Joe (Weling) = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed on November 12 south of Guam. Moving west-northwest, the system organized into a tropical depression in the Philippine Sea on November 17, and then a tropical storm on November 20. Joe recurved just east of the Philippines due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge, strengthening into a typhoon on November 20. East of Taiwan, Joe weakened back into a tropical storm due to strong southwest winds aloft on November 23 and then a tropical depression on November 24. Turning southeast, the remaining low level circulation continued weakening, dissipating on November 25.\n= = = November Tropical Depression = = =\nA tropical depression formed in the southern South China sea on November 24, dissipating the following day without making landfall on any neighbouring land mass. This depression was acknowledged by the Hong Kong Royal Observatory in their year end summary.\n= = = Super Typhoon Kim (Yaning) = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed south of Majuro on November 27. The small system developed quickly, becoming a tropical depression later that day, a tropical storm on November 28, and a typhoon on November 29. Kim turned northwest later the day due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge, before a strengthening high pressure system to its north forced a more westerly track by December 2, with Kim becoming a super typhoon soon afterward. The cyclone moved just north of Saipan, knocking out all electricity and water. Damage on the island totalled US $15 million (1986 dollars). Retaining super typhoon intensity into December 3, the system weakened and turned northwest on December 4 due to another weakness in the subtropical ridge. The high pressure system to its north restrengthened, turning Kim back to the west on December 5. On December 8, Kim made a cyclonic, or counter clockwise, loop due to a strong surface high building to its north, which was completed on December 11. During the loop, Kim weakened back into a tropical storm, with tropical depression status regained by December 12 as Kim moved northwest. The system recurved east of Taiwan, dissipating by December 14.\n= = = Severe Tropical Storm Lex = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed on November 30 in the wake of Kim near the International Dateline. The system moved west-northwest, developing into a tropical depression and tropical storm on December 4. Lex remained a tropical storm for one day, before weakening back into a tropical disturbance on December 5 due to vertical wind shear caused by Typhoon Kim and an upper trough nearby from the northwest. The depression passed between Guam and Saipan on December 7. Lex recurved south of Iwo Jima on December 8 before becoming an extratropical cyclone on December 9.\n= = = Typhoon Marge (Aning) = = =\nA long tracked system, the initial tropical disturbance which led to Marge was noted near the International Dateline on December 10. Moving north of due west the disturbance was slow to organize, becoming a tropical depression on December 14 southwest of Enewetak. The system strengthened into a tropical storm on December 15, and a typhoon by December 17. Early on December 20, Marge peaked in intensity before turning south of due west due to a strong surface high to its north. On December 21, Marge moved into the southern Philippines which accelerated its weakening trend. On December 22, Marge regained tropical storm status and soon after moving into the South China sea, the cyclone weakened into a tropical depression late on December 23. The depression moved westward for another day before dissipating on December 24. Marge's circulation aided the global journey of the Rutan Voyager aircraft, which went on to circle the Earth on one tank of fuel.\n= = = Typhoon Norris (Bidang) = = =\nThe initial tropical disturbance formed near the International Dateline on December 17, and initially moved west-northwest. The system slowly organized, becoming a tropical depression December 21, and then a tropical storm on December 23 as it turned more to the west due to a strengthening ridge of high pressure to its north. The cyclone steadily strengthened over the next four days, initially hampered by strong east winds aloft. As the storm moved south of Guam, wind gusts to 50 knots (93 km / h) were recorded on the island. Norris became a typhoon on December 27. Over the next day and half, intensification continued. On December 28, a strong surface high pressure system turned Norris to the southwest, and led to slow weakening. The cyclone regained tropical storm strength on December 30 while turning more to the west. Norris crossed the southern Philippines on December 31 and January 1, weakening into a tropical depression as it emerged into the South China sea. Strong southeast winds aloft prevented redevelopment of the depression. Norris' remnant circulation turned northwest and dissipated on January 2 well to the south of Hong Kong.\n= = Storm names = =\nDuring the season 26 named tropical cyclones developed in the Western Pacific and were named by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, when it was determined that they had become tropical storms.

Names not retired from this list will be used again in the 1990 season. This is the same list used for the 1982 season. PAGASA uses its own naming scheme that starts in the Filipino alphabet, with names of Filipino female names ending with \"ng\" (A, B, K, D, etc.).

Percy then devastated the island of Tokelau, leaving many homeless and millions in dollars in property damages (although exact damage figures are unavailable). Because of warnings in anticipation of the storm, there were no deaths and there were only a few injuries.\n= = Meteorological history = =\nOn February 23, the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Nadi reported that Tropical Disturbance 10F, had developed within the monsoon trough about 700 kilometres (435 mi) to the west of the Tuvaluan atoll: Funafuti.\n10F was first identified as a tropical disturbance embedded in an active monsoon trough at 23 / 0000 UTC, approximately 380 miles to the west of Funafuti and moving eastwards about 05 to 10 knots. The system was then located just south of a 250-hPa ridge axis, in a diffluent region. Shear and diurnal variations were evidently influencing development. SST was around 31 ° C. Later on the 24th, shear had decreased markedly. Outflow was favourable and developing in all quadrants. Overnight, the depression underwent explosive development with the deep convection increasing spatially and in organization whilst cooling. Spiral bands were also wrapping tightly around the llcc. By 24 / 1800 UTC, TD10F was named Tropical Cyclone Percy, while located roughly 100 miles to the east of Funafuti and moving east-southeast at 14 knots under a deep west-northwest steering flow.\nA discernible area of low pressure formed east of Tonga on February 23. The area of low pressure moved eastward, where it strengthened into Tropical Depression 10F a day later. Since the depression was located in an area of low wind shear and warm water temperatures, it was able to quickly strengthen into Tropical Storm Percy. At this point in time, Percy was located 120 miles (190 km) east of Fongafale, Tuvalu, and was moving towards the east-southeast at 14 kt (16 mph, 26 km / h). On February 26, Percy reached Category 1 status, while located 400 miles (644 km) north of American Samoa. While Percy moved east-southeast, a shortwave trough developed southwest of the storm. The trough caused the cyclone to intensify even further to a Category 3 storm as it passed between Fakaofa and Swains Island. Percy then reached Category 4 status north of Pago Pago as it winds reached over 135 mph (115 knots, 213 km / h) and the barometric pressure at its center fell to 925 millibars. On February 27, Cyclone Percy encountered a high pressure ridge which slowed its forward speed. Because of this, the cyclone's structure became elliptical, which caused the cyclone to weaken back to Category 3 status. By February 28, Percy bypassed the Pukapuka and Nassau Islands as a Category 3 cyclone as it continued to move east-southeast.\nBy then, the cyclone was re-organizing as the storm steered to the southeast. On March 2, Percy reached its second peak intensity. Its winds reached 160 mph (140 knots, 265 km / h) on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and an estimated barometric pressure of 900 millibars. Cyclone Percy maintained Category 5 status for 18 hours, while located 110 mi (177 km) west of Palmerston Island. After reaching Category 5 status, Percy began to weaken, due to increasing wind shear. During its weakening phase, Cyclone Percy passed south of Tropical Depression 20S. Pulled by an upper level trough, Percy swung to the east, passing Tropical Depression 24S in the process, before being caught up by another trough. By March 4, the center of Percy became detached from the main area of convection and Percy quickly weakened to a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Percy then quickly accelerated to 20 kt (23 mph, 37 km / h) as it became an extratropical storm. Percy briefly entered the New Zealand area of responsibility before becoming extratropical at 1200 UTC. By March 5, the remnants of Percy finally dissipated 700 mi (1127 km) southwest of Rarotonga.\n= = Preparations = =\nWhen Percy quickly reached cyclone strength, forecasters began to issue watches and warnings for the American Samoa and Tokelau areas, which were impacted by earlier storms Nancy and Olaf. As Percy continued to move eastward, forecasters predicted the storm to strengthen into a Category 2 or Category 3 storm within 12 – 24 hours. meanwhile, forecasters issued gale warnings for Tokelau. On 26 February, forecasters predicted Percy would stay on its current track and miss the island of Atafu by 50 – 70 miles (80 – 113 km), even though the storm could bring damaging gale force winds and heavy rains to the island. However, forecasters predicted Percy would make landfall on Tokelau. In American Samoa, hurricane warnings were issued for Swains Island, while the rest of American Samoa remained under a hurricane watch. Later, the gale warnings for Tokelau were changed to hurricane warnings as Percy moved to within 75 miles (121 km) north of Atafu. In Nukunou and Fakaofo, forecasters predicted that the cyclone would bring 60-70 mph (95 – 111 km / h) winds, heavy rains and possible flooding in low lying areas.\nForecasters predicted that Cyclone Percy was going to turn to the southeast and hit the islands of Pukapuka and Nassau directly. Because of this, evacuations were ordered and emergency shelters were activated in Rarotonga. Forecasters also predicted that Percy was going to cause a strong storm surge. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NOAA also predicted that the storm was going to strengthen further within 12 – 24 hours. In addition, forecast models predicted that Cyclone Percy would take a similar track like Cyclone Olaf weeks earlier. That prompted officials in the southern Cook Islands to order evacuations.\n= = Impact = =\nLike the earlier cyclones Meena, Nancy, and Olaf, Percy left widespread damage across Swains Island, Tokelau, and the northern Cook Islands. However, because of well-executed warnings, there were no deaths and there were only a few injuries. Percy was the worst cyclone to strike Tokelau since a similar cyclone hit the area in 1966.\n= = = American Samoa and Tokelau = = =\nThe strong winds from Percy knocked out power and communications infrastructure in Swains Island. Efforts to re-establish contact with the island were unsuccessful for a week. After the storm, however, all eight people who rode out the storm survived, though nine of the eleven buildings on the islands were destroyed or severely damaged. Damage in American Samoa was minimal. In Tokelau, Percy damaged trees and knocked down powerlines. During the height of the storm, one person was injured by flying debris, and two others were swept out to sea, but all three survived. In Nokonunu, the cyclone destroyed the only school and damaged 80% of the structures. The local hospital completely lost power during the storm and its emergency generator was overwhelmed by the flooding.\nIn Fakaofo, the storm surge from Percy damaged a sea wall and caused major beach erosion. One house was destroyed while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of the coconut harvest and 50% of the livestock were killed by the cyclone. Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was also significant as the storm damaged much of the banana and pandanus harvests. The schools in Atafu suffered only minimal damage (mostly wind damage).\n= = = Cook Islands = = =\nThe northern Cook Islands were hardest hit by Percy as the storm left 640 people homeless, of which 600 were in Pukapuka, and 40 were in Nassau. Of the buildings and houses destroyed or severely damaged, only ten were left standing. One person was rescued when his fishing boat stalled during the storm. Percy also damaged a solar power station, making it inoperable. Percy also battered the southern Cook Islands while weakening, although the damage there was minimal.\n= = Aftermath = =\nRelief efforts followed after Cyclone Percy. In Swains Island, a rescue plane dropped food and supplies. In Tokelau and northern Cook Islands, the governments of Australia and New Zealand offered over $200,000 dollars (2005 USD) in relief aid.\nIn Tokelau, many of the local officials feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash, and other debris in the ocean and across the island. There was also an increase of mosquitoes and other insects, increasing the threat of a dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged many of the hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult. Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier."

                "text": "= O Street Market =\nO Street Market, also known as Northern Market, is a historic structure located at 1400 7th Street NW in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Built in 1881, it is one of three 19th-century public market buildings still standing in the city, along with Eastern Market and Georgetown Market. The market was listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1968 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The most distinctive architectural element of the Gothic Revival building is its corner tower on 7th and O Streets.\nFor decades, the market was a vital shopping destination for area residents. Following World War II, the market and surrounding neighborhood began to deteriorate. The building was slightly damaged during the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots, but was restored and reopened in 1980. Renovations were to begin in 2003, but in February of that year, the building's roof collapsed under snow following a historic blizzard. A decade later, the rehabilitated building reopened as part of a $325 million mixed-use development, CityMarket at O.\n= = History = =\n= = = 19th century = = =\nFollowing the Civil War, local government officials led by Board of Public Works head Alexander \"Boss\" Shepherd sought to change the image of Washington, D.C., as a small, unattractive city. Among the many improvements Shepherd planned was the replacement of the city's existing public markets with new, brick facilities in heavily populated neighborhoods. One of the older markets, Northern Liberties Market at Mount Vernon Square, was razed in 1872. Many vendors refused to leave the market and several were killed during the demolition. With the help of businessmen, other vendors started the Northern Liberty Market Company (NLMC), which in 1875 opened a new public market at 5th and K Streets NW, in what is the present-day Mount Vernon Triangle neighborhood.\nShepherd nevertheless moved ahead with plans for a city-owned public market, and allocated land for the facility on the southwest corner of Square 446 (a city block bounded by 6th, 7th, O, and P Streets NW). As he did with many citywide improvement projects, Shepherd awarded contracts to businesses in which he owned large amounts of stock. After this corrupt practice was discovered, Shepherd was relieved of his post and many of the city projects he spearheaded were abandoned — including the new market.\nThe Northern Liberties Market struggled financially, as many residents found it too far from the commercial district on 7th Street. The NLMC sought to relocate, and in 1881 purchased the southwest corner of Square 422 (a city block bounded by 7th, 8th, O, and P Streets NW). Butcher Michael Hoover owned Square 422 in the early 1800s and sold it to printer Andrew Rothwell about 1845. Rothwell made many improvements to the property and added gardens which became popularly known as Rothwell's Gardens. The NLMC applied for building permits for a $15,000 ($367,810 in 2016 dollars), one-story brick building on May 31, 1881. The permit was signed by NLMC president Jesse B. Wilson. The new building was named O Street Market to avoid confusion with the company's other markets.\n= = = 20th century = = =\nThe area surrounding the O Street Market, known as Shaw, was demographically mixed. The white population included a large number of German immigrants, many of whom were vendors at the market. 7th Street NW was the heart of the city's Jewish community, and a significant number of African Americans lived in the neighborhood. The market continued to thrive even as the demographic and retail nature of the area neighborhood dramatically changed. By the 1920s, Shaw was overwhelmingly black, black vendors had supplanted the German American retailers at the market, and black-owned and operated businesses formed new retail corridors along 7th, 9th, and 14th Streets between P and U Streets. The market and Shaw neighborhood both deteriorated after World War II. By the 1960s, the market faced heavy competition from modern grocery stores and fell into disrepair. Local residents picketed the market, which led the city to enforce cleanliness regulations and building codes at the facility.\nIn 1966, the District of Columbia, the National Capital Planning Commission, and the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA; a joint city-federal agency overseeing redevelopment in the city) announced the establishment of the Shaw Urban Renewal Area. The 1968 riots caused only minor damage to the building, but the market did not reopen afterward. The closure of the market and many other nearby businesses caused a widespread decline in the neighborhood, and left local residents without easy access to retail establishments. In 1972, the Council of the District of Columbia approved a $30.4 million ($185.2 million in 2016 dollars) plan which, in part, provided for the purchase the O Street Market and its demolition. A modern shopping mall was planned for the site. The RLA purchased the property from the NLMC. Although neighborhood residents wanted the market torn down, the RLA declined to order its destruction. In 1974, the RLA proposed renovating the O Street Market and making it the retail centerpiece of a revived Shaw neighborhood. The agency awarded a $338,974 ($1,626,481 in 2016 dollars) contract in June 1974 to the firm of James Cox & Sons to renovate the structure.\nIn 1977, local African American entrepreneur James C. Adkins purchased the market and the rest of Square 422 for $200,000 ($780,999 in 2016 dollars). Adkins began construction on a modern grocery store next to the O Street Market, and won a $1.75 million ($68.3 million in 2016 dollars) loan from the federal Economic Development Administration to help renovate the 1881 market building. Adkins said he would add stalls inside and outside the market and lease them to food and other vendors. Renovation of the historic structure was more costly than anticipated, and Adkins was forced to seek an additional $300,000 ($978,129 in 2016 dollars) in 1979 to complete its rehabilitation. Adkins, who had also purchased Square 426, successfully petitioned the National Capital Planning Commission to close 8th Street between P and O Streets NW. Adkins planned to turn the street into a pedestrian mall, parking lot, and landscaped area. Giant Food opened on October 10, 1979, and the O Street Market reopened on February 23, 1980.\nOn March 31, 1994, during the two-decade crime wave of the 1980s and 1990s, the O Street Market was the site of a deadly shooting rampage. Seventeen-year-old Kevin Aaron McCrimmon paid five young men to kill 15-year-old Duwan A'Vant, who was known to frequent the market, because A'Vant had reportedly stolen a car from McCrimmon. At around 7 pm, the five men entered the market and fired more than 30 rounds, killing A'Vant and wounding eight others (including a toddler and two elderly women). Although there were 399 homicides in the city that year, the event shocked residents because it was such a brazen attack in a public place.\nBy the late 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The structure fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, and drug dealers and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, and the city threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.\nBecause O Street Market is one of only three 19th-century public market buildings remaining in Washington, D.C., it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1995. It was previously added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on July 24, 1968.\n= = = 21st century = = =\nIn 2001, local firm Roadside Development purchased the building with plans to rehabilitate the facility along with the Madison Retail Group. They proposed the partial closure of a 40-foot-wide (12 m) plaza on 8th Street to be replaced with a sidewalk, parking lot, and retail space, and for the addition of new windows in the walls. The D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board refused to authorize these changes, but the renovation of the interior was approved. The last tenants, consisting of small restaurants and shops, vacated the structure in late 2002 in preparation for remodeling set to begin in March or April 2003. On February 18, 2003, following a historic blizzard, the roof collapsed.\nRedevelopment of the O Street Market was delayed for two years as the developers sought to meet the demands imposed by the Historic Preservation Review Board. Community leaders and neighborhood residents regularly called for the project to resume in hopes that it would spur other development and decrease gang activity in the area.\nRoadside Development proposed a significantly expanded redevelopment in June 2004 that included most of Square 422. The company determined that the only way to make the O Street Market viable was to greatly enhance parking at the site. It could not do so without building extensive underground parking, and to build the parking garage would require construction of new buildings adjacent to the O Street Market and the Giant Food grocery store. The company initially proposed a $100 million project consisting of new construction and renovations which would add condominiums, apartments, a two-story underground parking garage, and either a new or renovated grocery store. By March 2005, when Roadside Development won its first design and zoning approval reviews, the plan had expanded into a $260 million project which included a 180-room hotel, 300 condominiums, 300 apartments, 700 underground parking spaces, and 7,500 square feet (700 m2) of new retail space. The O Street Market would be restored, renovated and incorporated into a new 65,000 sq ft (6,000 m2) Giant Food store. The proposal also called for the city to reopen 8th Street NW.\nThe O Street Market redevelopment received a setback in November 2007 when the District of Columbia Zoning Commission demanded that the development reduce the height of the new buildings to 90 feet (27 m) from 110 feet (34 m) and refused to reconsider its decision. Local residents denounced the zoning board's actions, which they perceived as imperiling redevelopment of their poverty-stricken neighborhood. After Roadside met the height requirements by removing penthouse apartments, the zoning commission approved the project in late March 2008. The project received its final approvals from the Historic Preservation Review Board and the D.C. Office of Planning in April and May 2008.\nBy mid-summer 2008, the cost of the project had grown to $325 million. Now named \"CityMarket at O\", the nine-story development included over 600 units of housing, a 200-room hotel, retail space, and a new Giant supermarket almost doubling the size of the existing store. Mayor Adrian Fenty announced the city government would provide $35 million in tax increment financing (TIF) and plans were made to break ground in late 2009. The city also contributed $1 million toward the construction of the rent-controlled apartments for low-income residents, and $1.5 million in pre-development grants. Rising costs and delays pushed the project's cost higher, and by the time the city council acted, the city's TIF commitment had risen to $46.5 million.\nThe official CityMarket groundbreaking ceremony was held September 1, 2010. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided a $117 million loan for the development and the Obama administration chose CityMarket at O as one of 14 nationwide projects to receive expedited permitting and environmental reviews in order to provide hundreds of infrastructure jobs. The Giant Food store closed and was razed in mid-2011, and Cambria Suites agreed to operate the hotel in October. The project was designed by Shalom Baranes Associates and built by Clark Construction.\nThe new development opened in stages beginning in 2013. The 90-unit low-income senior housing apartment complex opened on August 21, 2013, and the 555-unit luxury apartment building was occupied on November 4. The apartment buildings offered a combined 86,000 sq ft (8,000 m2) of retail space. The new Giant opened on November 21, 2013. The 72,000 sq ft (6,700 m2) grocery store includes a cafe and bar built into the O Street Market's historic tower. In the middle of the store, arches utilizing some of the original brickwork designate the former location of the market's exterior wall. Progressive Grocer, an industry trade journal, gave an award for best overall design to the new Giant Food store in 2014. In 2015, CityMarket at O was a winner of the Urban Land Institute's Global Awards for Excellence competition. The 182-room Cambria Suites hotel opened in May 2014. The final phase of the development, 880 P, is a 142-unit apartment building under construction and expected to be completed in 2017.\n= = Original design = =\nO Street Market previously consisted of between 12,000 sq ft (1,100 m2) and 12,500 sq ft (1,160 m2) on the main level and a 4,500 sq ft (420 m2) basement. The facade of the original one-story, rectangular brick building is 95 ft (29 m) wide and 150 ft (46 m) long. The most distinctive feature of this Gothic Revival section is the square tower on the northwest corner of 7th and O Streets NW. A gable roof and a monitor run the length of the remaining portion of the original facade. Including the tower, there are six bays on the 7th Street facade and five on the O Street facade. On the 7th Street facade, each bay features a pair of doors and transom windows. The bays on the O Street facade also have double doors and transom windows, except for the central bay, which projects and features a large window. The second and fourth bay transom windows on the O Street facade are surmounted by double-hung windows.\nThe tower is crowned with a large pyramidal roof and dormers. On each street-facing facade of the tower there are two sets of doors with large transom windows. Each set of doors is framed by columns topped with cast iron foliate capitals. The columns support a projection that features decorative brickwork and a segmental arch. The windows on the second level of the tower are surmounted by a decorative wood panel and corbelled cornice."

Jackson played 15 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons between 1929 and 1944 for the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Americans and Boston Bruins. He was a member of the famed Kid Line with Joe Primeau and Charlie Conacher, one of the early NHL's dominant scoring trios. Jackson led the league in scoring in 1931 – 32 and was member of Toronto's 1932 Stanley Cup championship team. He was named to five NHL All-Star Teams and played in three benefit all-star games, including the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, the first all-star game in NHL history.\nOff the ice, Jackson was well known for his high-spending lifestyle and drinking habit that prompted his trade from Toronto to New York in 1939. He was remembered as one of hockey's tragic figures following his retirement, as he struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulty. He was a figure of controversy within the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee as Jackson's lifestyle and personal problems were used to block his induction.

Jackson scored four goals in four regular season games that season, and though the Marlboros were considered a favourite to win the Memorial Cup, the team was defeated in the Eastern final by the Ottawa Gunners. He returned to the team for the 1928 – 29 season, scoring 10 goals and 14 points in 9 regular season games. He then led the OHA playoffs with seven goals and nine points as the Marlboros won the OHA championship. Jackson was a leading offensive player for Toronto in the 1929 Memorial Cup playdowns, scoring 15 goals and 25 points in 13 games. The Marlboros reached the final, defeating the Elmwood Millionaires in a best-of-three series to win the franchise's first Memorial Cup championship.\n= = = Toronto Maple Leafs = = =\nJoining the Maple Leafs for the 1929 – 30 season, 18-year-old Jackson was the youngest player in the National Hockey League (NHL). In his league debut, against the Montreal Canadiens, Jackson knocked over his idol Howie Morenz with a bodycheck. Assessing the youngster's potential following the hit, Morenz offered, \"you'll do\". Jackson appeared in 31 games for the Maple Leafs, scoring 12 goals and adding 6 assists. He missed some time due to injury, during which he earned his nickname from the team's trainer, Tim Daly. According to Jackson: \"Daly asked me to carry sticks for him. I told him I wasn't a stick boy, I was a hockey player. So he said I was nothing but a fresh busher [a term for someone who had just been called up from the minors] and the name stuck.\"\nDuring his first season, Jackson was placed on a line with two other young players. Charlie Conacher, a teammate of his with the Marlboros, played right wing and Joe Primeau was their centre. The trio formed what became known as the \"Kid Line\", one of the early NHL's most famous scoring trios. Primeau was the playmaker whose passes set up both Conacher and Jackson's goal-scoring ability.\nFollowing a 31-point season in 1930 – 31, Jackson led the NHL in scoring with 53 points in 1931 – 32. At 21 years, 3 months old, Jackson became the youngest scoring champion in NHL history, a record he would hold until broken by Wayne Gretzky in 1980 – 81. Jackson's 28 goals that season was the most he would score in his career, and he was named to the NHL's First All-Star Team for the first time of his career. He added five goals in the 1932 playoffs, including one of Toronto's six in the deciding game of the 1932 Stanley Cup Final, a 6 – 4 victory over the New York Rangers that clinched Toronto's first Stanley Cup championship since 1922.\nThe Kid Line remained Toronto's top offensive threat for several years; Jackson, Conacher and Primeau were the team's top three scorers for four consecutive seasons between 1932 and 1935. Following his league-leading season, Jackson led Toronto offensively in 1932 – 33 with 44 points. On November 20, 1934, Jackson set an NHL record when he became the first player in NHL history to score four goals in a period, notching four markers in the third period of a 5 – 2 victory over the St. Louis Eagles. The record has not been surpassed through 2012, though eleven players have matched it. He was named to three additional All-Star Teams during this time, placed on the second team in 1932 – 33 and on the first team in both 1933 – 34 and 1934 – 35. Additionally, Jackson played in the Ace Bailey Benefit Game on February 14, 1934. Held in support of injured teammate Ace Bailey, it was the first all-star game in NHL history. Jackson scored two goals for the Maple Leafs in a 7 – 3 victory over the NHL All-Stars.\nFollowing four consecutive 20-goal seasons, Jackson slipped to 11 goals in 1935 – 36. The Kid Line was finally broken up. While they remain consistent offensive performers, they lacked defensive ability and opposing teams began to find success playing their own top scoring lines against the trio. Primeau subsequently retired in 1936 in favour of his business interests. Despite the break-up, Jackson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 1936 – 37 to earn his fourth and final appearance on the First All-Star Team.\nPrior to the start of the 1937 – 38 season, Jackson played with the NHL All-Stars in the Howie Morenz Memorial Game, the NHL's second benefit all-star contest. In regular league play, his offence entered a decline as he scored 34 points that season, then 27 in 1938 – 39. Following the season, the Maple Leafs traded him to the New York Americans along with Jimmy Fowler, Murray Armstrong, Doc Romnes and Buzz Boll in exchange for Sweeney Schriner on May 18, 1939. The five-for-one deal was unprecedented in NHL history at that time.\n= = = New York and Boston = = =\nPrior to his first season in New York, Jackson played in his third benefit all-star game, the Babe Siebert Memorial Game, on October 29, 1939. He represented the NHL All-Stars in a 5 – 2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. In NHL play, he posted 12 goals and 20 points for the Americans, then improved to 26 points in 1940 – 41. He was unable to come to terms with team manager Red Dutton on a new contract for the 1941 – 42 season however, and did not join the team at the start of the season. The impasse lasted for half the season, until Dutton sold Jackson's rights to the Boston Bruins for $7,500 on January 4, 1942.\nJoining the Bruins gave Jackson the opportunity to play alongside his younger brother Art. He played only 26 games that season due to his holdout, just over half of an NHL season of 48 games, scoring 12 points. Though he played the left wing throughout his career, the Bruins switched him part-time to defence when they lost players to injury or the Second World War. He scored 34 points in 1942 – 43, and his 19 goals was Jackson's highest total in six seasons. The Bruins reached the 1943 Stanley Cup Final by defeating Montreal, but lost the series to the Detroit Red Wings in four straight games. Jackson played a final season in 1943 – 44, after which he announced his retirement as a player following a 15-year career.\n= = Personal life = =\nA handsome man with even features, Jackson lived a lifestyle of a Hollywood actor during his playing career, spending money freely, driving fast cars and attending posh parties. Maple Leafs' owner Conn Smythe unsuccessfully tried to convince Jackson to save his money for the future, even offering to match his player's savings dollar for dollar. Jackson's habits, particularly his drinking, ultimately played a role in his trade away from Toronto. Jackson's lifestyle came crashing down following his retirement as a player as he no longer had the money to fund his pursuits. He unsuccessfully tried to overcome his alcoholism, lost two marriages to divorce, struggled to hold a job, and it was said that he could be found outside Maple Leaf Gardens trying to sell broken sticks of Maple Leaf players to try to make some money. He emerged as one of hockey's tragic figures.\nJackson suffered a series of injuries and ailments in his later years. In 1958, he broke his neck after falling down a flight of stairs. His recovery took 18-months and cost him mobility in his right hand. Two months after his release, Jackson returned to hospital with a bout of jaundice. He was hospitalized again in 1962 following an epileptic seizure.\nAs Jackson's health failed, he became the focus of a controversy within the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee. Though he was considered one of hockey's greatest left wingers, and he was famed for his offensive, attacking style and backhand shot, Jackson's personal problems led Conn Smythe to blacklist him from entry into the Hall. Though Primeau and Conacher had gained induction, Jackson died on June 25, 1966, without being given the same honour. It would be another five years until the remainder of the selection committee finally overruled Smythe and posthumously inducted Jackson into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1971. Smythe quit the committee in protest, while Jackson's son Kim accepted the honour on his father's behalf. In 1975, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, and The Hockey News ranked him 55th in its 1997 book, The Top 100 NHL players of All-Time.\n= = Career statistics = ="
